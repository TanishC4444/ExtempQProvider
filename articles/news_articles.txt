Article: In this article Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group Corp., speaks at the SoftBank World event in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images Masayoshi Son is making his biggest bet yet: that his brainchild SoftBank will be the center of a revolution driven by artificial intelligence. Now, the billionaire is hoping to replicate that success with a series of investments and acquisitions in AI firms that will put SoftBank at the center of a fundamental technological shift. "I vividly remember the first time he invited me to his home for dinner and sitting on his porch over a glass of wine, he started talking to me about singularity – the point at which machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence," Alok Sama, a former finance chief at SoftBank until 2016 and and president until 2019, told CNBC. That may go some way to explain what has been an aggressive drive over the past few years — but especially the last two — to put SoftBank at the center of the AI story. While Arm blueprints form the basis of the designs for nearly all the world's smartphones, these days, the company is looking to position itself as a key player in AI infrastructure. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is another marquee investment for SoftBank, with the Japanese giant saying recently that planned investments in the company will reach about 4.8 trillion Japanese yen ($32.7 billion). "SoftBank's AI strategy is comprehensive, spanning the entire AI stack from foundational semiconductors, software, infrastructure, and robotics to cutting-edge cloud services and end applications across critical verticals such as enterprise, education, health, and autonomous systems," Neil Shah, co-founder at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. Son's vision is to cohesively connect and deeply integrate these components, thereby establishing a powerful AI ecosystem designed to maximize long-term value for our shareholders." Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon SoftBank's stock performance since 2017, the year that its first Vision Fund was founded. There is a common theme behind SoftBank's investments in AI companies that comes directly from Son — namely, that these firms should be using advanced intelligence to be more competitive, successful, to make their product better and their customers happy, a person familiar with the company told CNBC. Major tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Tesla boss Elon Musk are now talking about robotics as a key application of AI — but Son was thinking about this more than a decade ago. Two years later, the two companies launched a humanoid robot called Pepper, which they billed as "the world's first personal robot that can read emotions." Later, Son said: "In 30 years, I hope robots will become one of the core businesses in generating profits for the SoftBank group." SoftBank's bet on Pepper ultimately flopped for the company. But investments in Chinese technology companies and some bad bets on firms like WeWork soured sentiment for the Vision Fund as it racked up billions of dollars of losses by 2023. Vision but bad timing The market questioned some of Son's investments in companies like Uber and Didi, which were burning through cash at the time and had unclear unit economics. "When those companies came to head in 2021, 2022, Masa would have been in a perfect place but he had used all his ammunition on other companies," the former Vision Fund exec said. "When they came to age in 21, 22, the Vision Fund had invested in five or six hundred different companies and he was not in a position to invest in AI and he missed that." Son himself said this year that SoftBank wanted to invest in OpenAI as early as 2019, but it was Microsoft that ended up becoming the key investor.

Article: Al Jazeera Media Network condemns in the strongest terms the targeted assassination of its correspondents Anas Al Sharif and Mohammed Qraiqea, along with photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher, and Mohamed Nofal, by the Israeli occupation forces in yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom. In a statement by the Israeli occupation force, admitting to their crimes, the journalists were targeted by a directed assault towards the tent where they were stationed opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza. This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities. The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza. As Al Jazeera Media Network bids farewell to yet another group of its finest journalists, who boldly and courageously documented the plight of Gaza and its people since the onset of the war, it holds the Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists. Advertisement Despite losing several journalists to deliberate attacks and working under constant threat, Anas Al Sharif, Mohammed Qraiqea, and their colleagues persisted in the strip to ensure the world sees the harrowing truth experienced by Gaza’s populace. While vehemently condemning these heinous crimes and the ongoing attempts by Israeli authorities to silence the truth, Al Jazeera Media Network calls on the international community and all relevant organisations to take decisive measures to halt this ongoing genocide and end the deliberate targeting of journalists.

Article: The Israel Defense Forces said that it killed a man in Gaza who it claimed was posing as an Al Jazeera journalist, but the news network said that Anas al-Sharif was a journalist and that he and four other staff members were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike. The network reported that they died “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israel Defense Forces claimed that al-Sharif was "the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops." The IDF said in a statement about the killing that it had "previously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip" that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in a statement. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.” After an IDF spokesperson accused al-Sharif of being affiliated with Hamas' military wing in July, al-Sharif told the CPJ that he was being retaliated against for news coverage that made Israel look bad.

Article: As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations “are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.” "It’s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,” she said. Trump is having an enduring impact on the federal courts Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. “The Democrats’ extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump’s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.” Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. Challenging abortion care, medication, Planned Parenthood In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” — Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution’s protections for religious freedom. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a “barbaric practice” and “one of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable” in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. — Joshua Divine, a deputy solicitor general of Missouri who is nominated to be a district judge in the state, is currently representing Missouri in a case challenging the FDA approval of mifepristone. Divine co-authored the lawsuit, which includes misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb.” In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a “zealot" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as “the killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being” and argued that life begins at fertilization. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion. Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life, said she was hopeful the administration will continue nominating those “who will respect the rule of law.” Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time. Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said the courts, until now, have largely been an effective option for advocates to challenge state abortion bans and restrictions. “This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion — saying he’s going to leave it to the states while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," she said.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. ATLANTA — A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation. A union representing workers at the CDC said the incident was not random and “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured." It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk. Here's what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation: Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was “complex” and the investigation would take “an extended period of time." The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.” Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release. is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through "his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust.” Kennedy reached out to staff on Saturday, saying “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the campus. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff. White's father, who contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter, said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official. A neighbor of White told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.

Article: It hasn't been easy NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy — a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues — there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans — Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film “Sinners” earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album “Ain't Done with the Blues.” It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,” he tells The Associated Press over the phone, “I do the best I can to keep the blues alive.” He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons “Ain't Done with the Blues” is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten — like on the album closer “Talk to Your Daughter,” a rendition of the J.B. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of “Sinners.” Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, describes the current moment as a “resurgence of the blues,” following “Sinners.” “Several artists featured on the film’s soundtrack, which includes works from real-life blues, folk and country musicians, saw spikes the week of the film’s theatrical release,” he explains. “They ain’t never gonna come in and say, ‘I heard it on the radio.’” That's part of the reason why Guy decided to participate in the movie in the first place. “I hope this will give the blues a boost, because my worry right now is, like I said, a young person don’t know how good a gumbo is — you’ve got to taste it.” For now, he's excited to see how people respond to his new album, “Ain't Done with the Blues” — but he's not listening to it.

Tesla has sold more than a quarter of a million EVs and tens of thousands of home storage batteries in the UK, which could help it gain access to a sizeable customer base for an electricity supply business.

(Ramsay de Give/Pool Photo via AP, File) FILE - Actor Alec Baldwin attends his trial for involuntary manslaughter for the 2021 fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during filming of the Western movie "Rust," July 12, 2024, at the County District Court in Santa Fe, N.M. -- A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations in the 2021 fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie “Rust.” The judge in a ruling made public Wednesday dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of any significant action with the claim, which was filed in state district court earlier this year. Defendants include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office and the county board of commissioners. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor recently spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego’s Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.

Article: Australia said Monday that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing list of Western governments making the move as Israel becomes increasingly isolated over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” he said at a news conference after a cabinet meeting in Canberra. Though largely symbolic, they indicate a broader global shift against Israel’s policies in Gaza, where the United Nations and others say people are dying of malnutrition and starvation after months of limited or nonexistent aid. Albanese said Australia’s position was predicated on the commitments it had received from the Palestinian Authority, including that there would be no role for Hamas in any future Palestinian state.

Article: Lucy Letby: How the case of one baby death shows flaws in the medical evidence on both sides 18 minutes ago Share Save Jonathan Coffey BBC Panorama Share Save BBC When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Panorama Barrister Mark McDonald says his panel of leading experts found no evidence that any babies were deliberately harmed Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was "unlikely" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. "But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation." Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in pre-term babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Reuters In many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. Andy Rain/ EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Professor Neena Modi believes there is some postmortem evidence of air embolism but this is likely to have occurred during resuscitation (pictured far left, with Professor Shoo Lee far right) To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder." The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: "Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time." Julia Quenzler / BBC The needle theory was examined at length during Lucy Letby's trial It was a bombshell claim. One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver." Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his "opinion has not substantially changed". Lack of consensus among the experts The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Panorama Dr Mike Hall, Letby's original defence expert, says there is no record of a traumatic delivery in Baby O's medical notes However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know." The insulin evidence For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning.

Article: So these Ukrainian children spend summer together 42 minutes ago Share Save Will Vernon BBC News in Ukraine Share Save BBC Children comfort each other as they share their experiences of the war The day Russia's full-scale invasion began, Dima's dad told him he might never see him again. Dad said, 'I'm going to do everything I can so that you can live a normal life.'" Days later, Dima's father had joined the military and left for the front line. "Many of these children have multiple traumas because not only are their fathers missing, but some of them have uncles and grandmothers missing too," explains Vanui Martirosyan, lead psychologist at the charity. And we cannot work with them like with children with actual loss, because they do not have this point of starting grieving." She says many of the children spend hours trawling Russian social media channels, desperately searching for information about their family members. This type of trauma is maybe the most difficult to work with." The day after the campfire meeting, I speak to Dima, who wants to tell me more about his dad. I realised I wouldn't see my dad for a while." For many of the children the camp is an opportunity to escape the constant threat of missile strikes During all our interviews with the children, including with Dima, a Gen.Ukrainian psychologist was present. Then another soldier who was at Dad's position said they saw him dead, with shrapnel wounds to the head." Dima says the effect on both him and his mother was profound. "When Dad left, he said, 'Dima, no matter what happens you must look after Mum because you're a man, and you're her son."' Group therapy at the camp takes place daily, held in small rooms. One seven-year-old boy, Zahar, tells me his painting is called "Daddy comes home." It shows yellow stick men in front of a blue sky - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. "I love him very much and I know he loves me too," she continues, adding, "I hope we can make new memories with him again." This camp also offers the kids a chance to catch up on sleep, uninterrupted by air-raid sirens - and to just have fun and play.

Article: South Korea military shrinks by 20% due to low birthrate South Korea's military has fallen below the 500,000 threshold that experts say is needed to maintain defence readiness A study published by South Korean researchers in July had suggested that the country would need at least 500,000 soldiers to defend against an attack from the North, which is believed to have 1.3 million active-duty members. According to the defense ministry report on Sunday, the number of divisions in South Korea's military has dropped from 59 to 42 since 2006 - with the units either disbanded or merged with one another. The country has repeatedly broken its own record for having the world's lowest birth rate: 0.98 babies per woman in 2018, 0.84 in 2020, 0.72 in 2023 and 0.75 in 2024.

In May, new regulations went into effect that eased migrants’ ability to obtain residency and work permits, and the Spanish Parliament began debating a bill to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants. Last year the national birthrate was 1.4, the second lowest in the European Union and well below the 2.1 threshold needed to maintain the country’s population level of around 48 million people. The push for the undocumented immigrants’ amnesty did not originate with the government, tellingly, but with a popular petition that garnered 600,000 signatures and was endorsed by 900 nongovernmental organizations, business groups and even the Spanish Conference of Bishops.

Article: Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Albanese says toggle caption Mark Baker/AP WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so. His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a "humanitarian catastrophe." Australia's government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. "A two-state solution is humanity's best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza," Albanese said. "The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children." Ahead of Albanese's announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state. The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. Sponsor Message "This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all," Albanese said. A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state. In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government "will carefully weigh up its position" on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September.

Boluarte arrived in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta on Sunday afternoon, following an invitation President Prabowo extended when the two leaders met at the APEC Summit in Peru in November 2024. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. The two leaders are expected to witness the signing of CEPA that could be a major booster to bilateral trade, said Indonesia’s trade minister Budi Santoso ahead of the visit. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” Santoso said, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry’s data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File) FILE - Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., delivers his State of the Nation Address at the House of Representatives in Quezon City, Philippines, on July 28, 2025. said Monday his country would inevitably be drawn “kicking and screaming” into any war over Taiwan due to its proximity to the self-ruled island and the presence of large numbers of Filipino workers there, despite China’s strong protest over such remarks. Marcos also told a news conference that the Philippines' coast guard, navy and other vessels defending its territorial interests in the South China Sea would never back down and would stand their ground in the contested waters after the Chinese coast guard on Monday staged dangerous blocking maneuvers and used a powerful water cannon to try to drive away Philippine vessels from the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal. It’s the latest flare-up of long-simmering territorial disputes in the busy waterway, a key global trade route, where overlapping claims between China and the Philippines have escalated in recent years. Relations between China and the Philippines have been severely strained after Marcos, who took office in mid-2022, and his administration emerged as some of the most vocal critics in Asia of China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. The Marcos administration deepened its treaty alliance engagements with the United States and started broadening security alliances with other Western and Asian countries like Japan, Australia, India and some EU member states to strengthen deterrence against Beijing’s assertiveness. China protested last week and accused Marcos of interfering in its domestic affairs and violating its “One China” policy when he told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to India that there was no way the Philippines could stay out of a possible war in Taiwan because of his country’s proximity to it and the presence of about 200,000 Filipino workers on the self-ruled island. The Chinese Foreign Ministry then said through a spokesperson that “'geographic location' and a ‘large volume of Filipinos’ in Taiwan should not be used as pretexts to interfere in the internal and sovereign affairs of other countries” and urged the Philippines “to earnestly abide by the One China principle” and “refrain from playing fire on issues bearing on China’s core interests.” Asked to comment on China’s protest, Marcos said he was perplexed and could not understand Beijing’s concern. We do not want to go to war, but I think if there is a war over Taiwan, we will be drawn, we will be pulled in whether we like it or not, kicking and screaming,” Marcos said. I hope it doesn’t happen, but, if it does, we have to plan for it already.” Separately, Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said Chinese coast guard ships chased and staged dangerous blocking maneuvers on Monday against Philippine coast guard and fishing vessels in the Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing atoll in the South China Sea off the northwestern Philippines.

Article: Late in the summer of 2021, Greer Jarrett set out on the first of 26 voyages to retrace the maritime paths taken by Norse sailors during the Viking Age, which lasted from roughly A.D. The Vikings, beyond their reputation as medieval bad boys — Pillage People, if you will — were accomplished traders who established commercial routes that stretched all the way to Baghdad. Jarrett, a doctoral candidate in archaeology at Lund University in Sweden, was intrigued not only by where these ancient mariners started and wound up, but also the paths they took to get there. Most of the journeys were undertaken in 30-foot fyringer, square-rigged, open clinker boats, built in the tradition of Afjord, a small Norwegian municipality where Viking-era boatbuilding techniques endured into the 20th century.

Article: A federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments on whether military troops deployed this summer by the Trump administration to Los Angeles violated a federal law that bars troops from conducting law enforcement duties within the country Trial to start on whether deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles violated federal law FILE - California National Guard members are positioned at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, on June 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File) SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act “fail as a matter of law.” They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

Article: Security footage from a hospital in Sweida in southern Syria shows what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb This is a locator map for Syria with its capital, Damascus. (AP Photo) DAMASCUS, Syria -- Footage from security cameras at a hospital in the city of Sweida in southern Syria published Sunday showed what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb. The video published by activist media collective Suwayda 24 was dated July 16, during intense clashes between militias of the Druze minority community and armed tribal groups and government forces. A Syrian government official said they could not immediately identify the attackers in the video, and are investigating the incident to try to figure out if they are government-affiliated personnel or gunmen from tribal groups. Abdul Qader Al-Tahhan was assigned to oversee the investigation "to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and arrested as quickly as possible.” “We condemn and denounce this act in the strongest terms, and we affirm that the perpetrators will be held accountable and brought to justice to receive their just punishment, regardless of their affiliations," the statement said. The incident at the Sweida National Hospital further exacerbates tensions between the Druze minority community and the Syrian government, after clashes in July between Druze and armed Bedouin groups sparked targeted sectarian attacks against them. Though the fighting has largely calmed down, government forces have surrounded the southern city and the Druze have said that little aid is going into the battered city, calling it a siege. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which has organized aid convoys into Sweida, said in a statement on Saturday that one of those convoys that was carrying aid in the day before “came under direct fire,” and some of its vehicles were damaged. It called for the government to “ensure credible, swift, transparent, impartial, and comprehensive investigations.” The statement also reiterated “obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transportation and equipment, as well as hospitals and medical facilities.” It expressed concern about "foreign terrorist fighters" in Syria, while calling on “all states to refrain from any action or interference that may further destabilize the country,” an apparent message to Israel, which intervened in last month's conflict on the side of the Druze, launching airstrikes on Syrian government forces.

Article: Joy Falatiya says she fell apart after her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in South Sudan in March 2024 People participate in a Self Help Plus session at St. (AP Photo/Florence Miettaux) MUNDRI, South Sudan -- Joy Falatiya said her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in March 2024 and that she fell apart after that. She told The Associated Press that her suicidal thoughts are now gone after months of psycho-social therapy, even though she still struggles to feed her children and can’t afford to keep them in school. ___ The clinic is in one of eight locations chosen for a project that aimed to provide mental health services for the first time to over 20,000 people across this East African country. Across South Sudan, there has been massive displacement of people in the civil war that began in 2013 when government troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fought those loyal to Vice President Riek Machar. to warn of a possible “relapse into large scale conflict.” The violence persists even today, with Machar under house arrest and government forces continuing with a campaign to weaken his ability to wage war. And poverty — over 90% of the country's people live on less than $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank — is rampant in many areas, adding to the mental health pressures many people face, according to experts. In South Sudan, suicide affects mostly the internally displaced, fueled by confinement and pressures related to poverty, idleness, armed conflict, and gender-based violence, according to the International Organization for Migration. "So the burden for the individuals, their families and their communities is huge in this country, and it has gone quite unaddressed so far.” Last month, authorities in Juba raised an alarm after 12 cases of suicide were reported in just a week in the South Sudan capital. Atong Ayuel Longar, one of South Sudan’s very few psychiatrists and the leader of the mental health department at the health ministry, said a pervasive sense of “uncertainty is what affects the population the most" amid the constant threat of war. Things are getting tough." In Mundri, the AP visited several mental health facilities in June and spoke to many patients, including women who have recently lost relatives in South Sudan's conflict. As one of the charities seeking to expand mental health services, the Catholic non-governmental organization Caritas organizes sessions of Self Help Plus, a group-based stress management course launched by WHO in 2021. Longar, the psychiatrist, said she believes the community must be equipped with tools “to heal and to help themselves by themselves, and break the cycle of trauma." But she worries about whether such support can be kept sustainable as funds continue to dwindle, reflecting the retreat by the United States from its once-generous foreign aid program. The project that may have helped save Falatiya's life, funded until November by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation and the Athens-based Stavros Niarchos Foundation, will come to an end without additional donor funding. “What happened to me in the past was very dangerous, but the thought of bad things can be removed,” Falatiya said, surveying a garden she cultivates outside her small home where a local man has allowed her to stay after taking pity on her.

(AP Photo) TEHRAN -- The deputy head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog will visit Iran in a bid to rekindle soured ties, the Islamic Republic's foreign minister said Sunday. “As long as we haven’t reached a new framework for cooperation, there will be no cooperation, and the new framework will definitely be based on the law passed by the Parliament,” Araghchi said. State media last week quoted Aragchi as saying during a television program that Tehran would only allow for IAEA cooperation through the approval of the Supreme National Security Council, the country’s highest security body. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

The Metropolitan Police Service released the updated figures as protesters demanding the immediate release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza held their own march through central London on Sunday afternoon. Backers of Palestine Action staged the protest to underscore their belief that the government is illegally restricting freedom of expression by banning a direct action organization that has challenged its policies. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who oversees law enforcement in Britain, rejected that characterization, saying Palestine Action was banned after committing serious attacks involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage. “The right to protest is one we protect fiercely but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organization,” Cooper said in a statement. Police said the process of deciding whether to file charges against those arrested is likely to take weeks as officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command put together case files and seek approval from prosecutors, and in some cases the attorney general.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez, file) Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said at a news conference in Canberra. Speaking a day after the protest, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that “there is a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognise.” “In relation to recognition, I’ve said for over a year now, it’s a matter of when, not if,” Wong added. The opposition Liberal Party criticised the move, saying it put Australia at odds with the United States, its closest ally, and reversed a bipartisan consensus that there should be no recognition while Hamas remains in control of Gaza. “Despite his words today, the reality is Anthony Albanese has committed Australia to recognising Palestine while hostages remain in tunnels under Gaza and with Hamas still in control of the population of Gaza. Advertisement “Recognising a Palestinian state prior to a return of the hostages and defeat of Hamas, as the Government has today, risks delivering Hamas one of its strategic objectives of the horrific terrorism of October 7.” The Australian Greens, the fourth-largest party in parliament, welcomed the move to recognise Palestine, but said the announcement did not meet the “overwhelming calls from the Australian public for the government to take material action”. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) also criticised the announcement, describing it as a “political fig leaf, letting Israel’s genocide and apartheid continue unchallenged, and distracting from Australia’s complicity in Israeli war crimes via ongoing weapons and components trade”. These “detailed and significant commitments” include the PA reaffirming it “recognises Israel’s right to exist in peace and security” and committing to “demilitarise and to hold general elections”, Albanese said while announcing the decision. Albanese said the commitments secured by Australia were “an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all”. New Zealand to decide on recognition next month Meanwhile, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Monday that his country’s cabinet will make a formal decision on Palestinian statehood in September. “Ultimately, New Zealand has an independent foreign policy, and on this issue, we intend to weigh up the issue carefully and then act according to New Zealand’s principles, values and national interest.” Peters said that while New Zealand has for some time considered the recognition of a Palestinian state a “matter of when, not if”, the issue is not “straightforward” or “clear-cut”. Over the next month, we look forward to canvassing this broad range of views before taking a proposal to Cabinet.” Of the UN’s 193 member states, 147 already recognise Palestinian statehood, representing some three-quarters of the world’s countries and the vast majority of its population. The announcements by Australia and New Zealand on Monday came hours after an Israeli attack killed five Al Jazeera staff members in Gaza City, and as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to threaten a full-scale invasion of the city in the north of the Gaza Strip.

Article: Trump demands homeless people 'immediately' move out of Washington DC Trump signed an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people, and he last week ordered federal law enforcement into the streets of Washington DC. US President Donald Trump has said homeless people must "move out" of Washington DC as he vowed to tackle crime in the city, but the mayor pushed back against the White House likening the capital to Baghdad. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The specifics of the president's plan are not yet clear, but in a 2022 speech he proposed moving homeless people to "high quality" tents on inexpensive land outside cities, while providing access to bathrooms and medical professionals. On Friday, Trump ordered federal agents - including from US Park Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the US Marshals Service - into Washington DC to curb what he called "totally out of control" levels of crime. "We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low." She criticised White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for dubbing the US capital "more violent than Baghdad". But federal data from January suggests that Washington DC last year recorded its lowest overall violent crime figures - once carjacking, assault and robberies are incorporated - in 30 years. In another post on Sunday he said the event at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT) would address ending "crime, murder and death" in the city, as well as its "physical renovation". Community Partnership, an organisation that works to reduce homelessness in Washington DC, told Reuters news agency that the city of 700,000 residents had about 3,782 people homeless on any given night.

He is transferring 100% ownership of the family-owned business to an employee trust which means staff will get a share of the profits and a say in how the firm is run. "If the business had been sold just for money that would not have been passing on the baton in the way in which the family would have wanted," Mr Grant told the BBC. "That's when I think the staff will start to see something a little bit more meaningful." Under an employee ownership trust, Mr Grant and his family will be financially rewarded, too. The Entertainer Gary Grant started the toy chain with one shop in 1981 "The Entertainer has thrived against all the odds," says Mr Grant, listing the financial crisis of 2008, the Covid pandemic, the decline of the High Street and the shift to online. The Entertainer Gary Grant pictured in 1981 in his first toy shop Two of their four children work in the company but Mr Grant says they have got "other plans for their lives" and after lengthy succession planning, which explored a number of exit options, the family chose an employee ownership trust. "We would have been very concerned selling to a business that has a completely different set of values to the values of the Entertainer which we've built over the last 44 years. The Entertainer Mr Grant hopes the move will preserve the family's legacy Two years ago the family appointed its first external chief executive, Andrew Murphy, from the John Lewis Partnership, the UK's biggest and best-known employee-owned business. In November, Mr Murphy told the BBC it had been forced to drop plans to open two new stores and freeze hiring at its head office after the government said it would raise National Insurance contributions for employers.

He told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster (GMU) programme that the man asked Fr Murray if he would hear his confession just before the morning service was due to start and "it was at that stage that he was attacked". 'Difficult to comprehend' Fr Murray was due to celebrate Mass at St Patrick's Church Fr McGee said Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, went to the hospital on Sunday night to meet with the family of Fr Murray and some of the clergy went to see the family of the man who has been killed. Fr McGee described Fr Murray as "very well known" and "very well respected priest" of the diocese who had been appointed a canon by the bishop in recognition for his work as a senior adviser. Fr Martin Graham, who took the service, said it was about being with the parishioners and praying with them, for Fr Murray and also "for the other poor man who lost his life". "It is just heartbreaking for them in what was supposed to be a poignant farewell this morning that it turned into something which was just grotesque." Sinn Fein councillor Oonagh Hanlon, who attended the vigil, described it as a "very sombre and very respectful" event which also remembered the man who was killed.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) DONETSK REGION, Ukraine -- In a dugout where each nearby blast sends dirt raining from the ceiling and the black plastic lining the walls slipping down, Ukrainian soldiers say peace talks feel distant and unlikely to end the war. President Donald Trump that there will be some " swapping of territories” — as well as media reports that it would involve Ukrainian troops leaving the Donetsk region where they have fought for years defending every inch of land — have stirred confusion and rejection among the soldiers. “At minimum, the result would be to stop active fighting — that would be the first sign of some kind of settlement,” said soldier Dmytro Loviniukov of the 148th Brigade. When direct talks between Russia and Ukraine were held in Istanbul in May, the soldiers from 148th brigade read the news with cautious hope, said a soldier with the call sign Bronson, who once worked as a tattoo artist. President Donald Trump reportedly gave Russia's Vladimir Putin — one that has since vanished from the agenda amid talk of a meeting in Alaska — the Russian fire roared every minute for hours. No one else will come here to defend us.” Dozens of kilometers from Zaporizhzhia region, north to the Donetsk area, heavy fighting grinds on toward Pokrovsk — now the epicenter of fighting. If we’re here, we need to cover our brothers in arms.” For Serhii Filimonov, commander of the “Da Vinci Wolves” battalion of the 59th brigade, the war’s end is nowhere in sight, and current news doesn’t influence the ongoing struggle to find enough resources to equip the unit that is fighting around Pokrovsk. The big question is what security guarantees we get — and how we hit pause."

Article: SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo — traditionally dependent on snow sports — are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists. “We used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,” said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president. Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. “The weather here is fantastic — it's not hot at all," said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week. The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years. Vasilije Knezevic, who leads quad tours of Jahorina’s highest peaks, noted that while the ski season was “bleak” because of the snow shortage, they are “having a fabulous summer so far.” Business might be growing in the mountains of Sarajevo, but it remains far less profitable than seaside destinations in neighboring Croatia, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of the country’s gross domestic product. Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik’s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders. While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to “extend the season” and become “year-round tourist destination,” in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.

Article: Kyiv, Ukraine – Taras, a seasoned Ukrainian serviceman recovering from a contusion, expects “no miracles” from United States President Donald Trump’s August 15 summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. “There’s going to be no miracles, no peace deal in a week, and Putin will try to make Trump believe that it is Ukraine that doesn’t want peace,” the fair-haired 32-year-old with a deep brown tan acquired in the trenches of eastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. Taras, who spent more than three years on the front line and said he had recently shot down an explosives-laden Russian drone barging at him in a field covered with explosion craters, withheld his last name in accordance with the wartime protocol. Putin wants to dupe Trump by pandering to the US president’s self-image as a peacemaker to avoid further economic sanctions, while the Russian leader seeks a major military breakthrough in eastern Ukraine, Taras said. “Putin really believes that until this winter, he will seize something sizeable, or that [his troops] will break through the front line and will dictate terms to Ukraine,” Taras said. As the Trump administration trumpets the upcoming Alaska summit as a major step towards securing a ceasefire, Ukrainians — civilians and military personnel — and experts are largely pessimistic about the outcomes of the meeting between the US and Russian presidents. Earlier this month, Russia intensified its push to seize key locations in the southeastern Donetsk region, ordering thousands of servicemen to conduct nearly-suicidal missions to infiltrate Ukrainian positions, guarded 24/7 by buzzing drones with night and thermal vision. Advertisement In the past three months, Russian forces have occupied some 1,500sq km (580 square miles), mostly in Donetsk, of which Russia controls about three-fourths, according to Ukrainian and Western estimates based on geolocated photos and videos. But Kyiv’s daring counteroffensive and Moscow’s inability to hold onto areas around the capital and in Ukraine’s north resulted in the loss of 9 percent of occupied lands by the fall of 2022. Russia has since re-occupied less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory, despite losing hundreds of thousands of servicemen, while pummelling Ukrainian cities almost daily with swarms of drones and missiles. Ukraine also controls a tiny border area in Russia’s western Kursk region, where it started a successful offensive in August 2024, but lost most of its gains earlier this year. In exchange, Moscow could offer a ceasefire and the freezing of the front line in other Ukrainian regions, as well as the retreat from tiny toeholds in Sumy and the northeastern Kharkiv region, according to the reports. But to give up Donetsk, Kyiv would have to vacate a “fortress belt” that stretches some 50km (31 miles) along a strategic highway between the towns of Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk. Donetsk’s surrender would “position Russian forces extremely well to renew their attacks on much more favorable terms, having avoided a long and bloody struggle for the ground,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said on Friday. Some civilian Ukrainians hold a gloomy view on the prospects of peace, believing that Kyiv’s tilt towards democracy and presumed eventual membership in the European Union, and Moscow’s “imperialistic nature” set up an equation that prevents a sustainable diplomatic solution. Advertisement “The war will go on until [either] Ukraine or Russia exist,” Iryna Kvasnevska, a biology teacher in Kyiv whose first cousin was killed in eastern Ukraine in 2023, told Al Jazeera. Despite Trump’s recent change in rhetoric and growing public dissatisfaction with Moscow’s reluctance to end the hostilities, the US president has a history of blaming Ukraine – for the war and its demands of its allies – while some of his negotiators have repeated Moscow’s talking points. It is also unclear whether Zelenskyy will be invited to a trilateral meet with Trump and Putin in Alaska, or whether the US will go ahead and seek to shape the future of Ukraine without Kyiv in the room. “Trump has let us down several times, and the people who believe he won’t do it again are very naive, if not stupid,” Leonid Cherkasin, a retired colonel from the Black Sea port of Odesa who fought pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk in 2014-2015 and suffered contusions, shrapnel and bullet wounds, told Al Jazeera. He referred to Trump’s pledges during his re-election campaign to “end the war in 24 hours”, and his ultimatums to impose crippling sanctions on Russia if Putin does not show progress in a peace settlement. Meanwhile, the very fact of a face-to-face with Trump heralds a diplomatic victory for Putin, who has become a political pariah in the West and faces child abduction charges that have led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant against him. “I think the deal will be limited to an agreement on cessation of air strikes, and Putin will get three months to finalise the land operations – that is, to seize the [entire] Donetsk region.” An air ceasefire may benefit Russia, as it can amass thousands of drones and hundreds of missiles for future attacks.

Article: Israel has assassinated Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif and four other staff in a targeted attack on a tent in Gaza City, taking the total number of journalists killed since October 7, 2023 to 269. Correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal were meeting in a media tent outside al-Shifa Hospital when they were targeted by a drone. “This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities,” the network said in a statement. “The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.” The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says it is “appalled” by Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalists. Since Israel launched its war on the enclave in October 2023, it has routinely accused Palestinian journalists in Gaza of being Hamas members, as part of what rights groups say is an effort to discredit their reporting of Israeli abuses.

British Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell in 1959 at the Admiralty Bay station - he was known for his love of the husky dogs "Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions," says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey . Dariusz Puczko The bones were found on the moraine and surface of the Ecology Glacier, on western shore of Admiralty Bay It was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959. David Bell, 86, spoke to BBC News from his home in Australia "One of the funniest things was, and I still can't get over this, one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema," David continues. "And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table," he says. Bell Dennis Bell is on the far right of the picture, celebrating Christmas in Antarctica in 1958 - seven months before he died Dennis Bell, nicked-named "Tink", was born in 1934. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Russell Thompson Men at the base on King George Island relied on sledges and dogs to get around the harsh terrain The British Antarctica Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and "ridiculously isolated" island. Reading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: "He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes." Russell Thompson Dennis Bell (on the left) was known for his sense of humour - he is re-enacting an advert on the snow in this picture Dennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions.

Dariusz Puczko The location were Dennis was found is unstable and high-risk with intense melting and many crevasses "The place where Dennis was found is not the same as the place where he went missing," the team explains. "It's an opportunity to reassess the contribution these men made, and an opportunity to promote science and what we've done in the Antarctic over many decades," says Rod Rhys Jones.

Due to Israel's military occupation, in the West Bank, the Palestinian authority, set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s, is not in full control of its land or people. Bettmann via Getty Images British troops lower the Union Flag to officially end British rule in Palestine in 1948 He went on to cite the 1917 Balfour Declaration - signed by his predecessor as foreign secretary Arthur Balfour - which first expressed Britain's support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". The phrase refers to the creation of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But international efforts to bring about a two-state solution have come to nothing and Israel's colonisation of large parts of the West Bank, illegal under international law, has turned the concept into a largely empty slogan. Australia has become the latest country to say it will recognise Palestinian Statehood at the next UN General Assembly in September - after similar announcements from France, Japan, Canada and the UK, on some conditions. If the UK and France do recognise a Palestinian state next month, Palestine would have the support of four of the UN Security Council's five permanent members - the other two being China and Russia. Successive British governments have talked about recognising a Palestinian state, but only as part of a peace process, ideally in conjunction with other Western allies and "at the moment of maximum impact". Health Secretary Wes Streeting summed up the views of many MPs when he urged the government to recognise Palestine "while there is still a state of Palestine left to recognise".

Article: Boston Public Library aims to increase access to a vast historic archive using AI toggle caption Aram Boghosian for Boston Public Library Boston Public Library, one of the oldest and largest public library systems in the country, is launching a project this summer with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to make its trove of historically significant government documents more accessible to the public. "It really is an incredible repository of primary source materials covering the whole history of the United States as it has been expressed through government publications," said Jessica Chapel, the Boston Public Library's chief of digital and online services. Researchers at the Harvard Law School Library's Institutional Data Initiative are working with libraries, museums and archives on a number of fronts, including training new AI models to help libraries enhance the searchability of their collections. (Microsoft and OpenAI are among the many AI players targeted by recent copyright infringement lawsuits, in which plaintiffs such as authors claim the companies stole their works without permission.) Sponsor Message "Having information institutions like libraries involved in building a sustainable data ecosystem for AI is critical, because it not just improves the amount of data we have available, it improves the quality of the data and our understanding of what's in it," said Burton Davis, vice president of Microsoft's intellectual property group. Access for all Greg Leppert, the Harvard Law School Library's Institutional Data Initiative's executive director, said it is not the goal of the initiative to grant AI companies privileged access to the rich troves of out-of-copyright information held at libraries and archives.

Article: So far in fiscal year 2025, tariffs have accounted for 2.7% of federal revenues — a jump over past years that will almost certainly climb higher if tariffs remain in place. "Historically, tariff revenue has never accounted for more than about 2% of total federal government revenues in the modern era," said Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. "And with the tariffs that are in place today, that could go up to 5% or perhaps even higher." Should tariff revenue eventually climb to that 5% level — that's significant, but it's not big enough to fulfill some of Trump's more outlandish promises. "And the purpose of what I'm doing is primarily to pay down debt, which will happen in very large quantity." Sponsor Message Tariff revenue is a tiny fraction of the national debt Tariff revenue right now is a tiny fraction of that debt, which stands near $37 trillion. While the new tariff revenue is considerable, there's a good chance it won't cover new debt that this administration just added in the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law last month. toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP There are more tariffs to come — but limits on how much tariff revenue can grow It is true, of course, that Trump is continually adding new tariffs. So while there's more tariff revenue now, she told NPR, "that must be offset against the lower revenue we're bringing in in income, payroll and corporate taxes as a result of the economy growing at only half the rate it was forecast before the year started." Sponsor Message Furthermore, Trump's other tariff aims could work against his revenue hopes, Reidl said. A federal court said in May that Trump did not have the authority to impose his country-by-country tariffs — which would include those that went into effect last week on places like India and Japan.

Article: Jena Ardell/Moment RF/Getty Images According to posts on TikTok, hormonal birth control can cause a nearly unlimited list of ailments: Depression, irreversible infertility, acne, destruction of the gut biome, weight gain, balding, and decreased libido to name a few. Sponsor Message Keep in mind, social media can skew accuracy of risk-benefit calculations when it comes to making decisions about birth control, says Emily Pfender, a researcher at University of Pennsylvania who has studied the way contraception is represented on social media. (Hormonal birth control methods have a failure rate of less than 1%, when used correctly.) " The old joke we used to say is that those that use natural family planning have naturally large families," says Dr. "But many of my patients have busy lives and this may not be the thing they want to focus on." Conti says one person's experience with these apps should not be predictive for others. "But telling you that this is the only way to do it is a very privileged approach because you're only considering your exact situation and scenario." The nuance Complaints about birth control get conflated with another, real issue – that women often feel overlooked in medical settings, says Pfender. "I did not know the risks," says Morris in the video, as she points to a picture of an X-ray where, she says, her IUD became embedded in her uterus. But Jensen says that in the short time clinicians often have with their patients, focusing on uncommon side effects may mean less time to focus on those that are more likely. With an IUD, for example, Jensen says, complications that require surgery are rare – one study suggested that for every 1,000 IUDs, between one and two result in "intrauterine migration," which can require surgery to remove, and this is often a minimally invasive procedure. Common side effects like irregular bleeding are more worthy of discussion, he says: "That's something that actually clinicians should do a much better job at focusing on." The bigger picture Clinicians stress the importance of weighing potential side effects of hormonal birth control against the risks of unplanned pregnancy. "Social media often gives no context around what exposure to pregnancy means to women." Maternal mortality rates have improved in the last century, but there are still significant health risks, says Jensen, as well as considerations of equality.

"Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people," the Qatari network said in a statement. International media have been mostly barred from entering Gaza throughout the war and Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside Gaza, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza and Brown University's Watson Institute in April said the war was "quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters." Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were "part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability." Sponsor Message The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that it was appalled by the strike.

The president promoted the news conference in multiple posts on his social media platform and on Sunday posted that it would "also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." In a separate post, Trump said the homeless should leave D.C., accompanied by photos of homeless encampments along his route from the White House to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." The news conference comes after Trump last week ordered an increase in law enforcement as part of an executive order he signed in March to "Make the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful." A White House official said the law enforcement effort a "whole of government approach to improve overall public safety" and said that law enforcement will "be focused on high traffic tourist areas and other known hotspots." The official added that federal officers "will be identified, in marked units, and highly visible." Trump said Sunday that he has given D.C. "The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. Bowser said Sunday that Washington has spent the last two years driving down violent crime, “driving it down to a 30 year low, in fact.” “It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023, this is 2025 and we've done that by working with the community, working with the police, working with our prosecutors, and, in fact, working with the federal government," Bowser told MSNBC. On Saturday, Trump said the nation’s capital has become “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” Last week he threatened to deploy the National Guard to D.C. And that also includes the graffiti that you see, the papers all over the place, the roads that are in bad shape, the medians that are falling down, the median in between roads, it's falling down,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. And that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last week, “Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long. President Trump is committed to making our Nation’s capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.” The seven-day law enforcement effort is being led by the U.S. Park Police but includes personnel from the Metro Transit Police Department, Amtrak Police Department, United States Capitol Police, Washington’s Metro Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Protective Service, Enforcement and Removal Operations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, United States Marshals Service, United States Attorney’s Office-District of Columbia, Department of Interior, Pre-Trial Services Agency, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), the White House official said.

Article: counterpart Donald Trump are still days away, but the two leaders' upcoming meeting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine is already seen as a victory for the Kremlin, the Russian economy and global financial markets. watch now There are concerns that Ukraine could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow, and the mood is dour in Kyiv, whose officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have so far not been invited to attend the talks. In the meantime, economists say the talks — which take place as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine, with no ceasefire deal in sight — are already a win for Putin and his war-centered economy that is laboring under international sanctions and stubbornly high inflation of 9.4% in June. this is a weak economy," Portes told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition." Coming into talks with a strong position in the battlefield, Russia is likely to want immediate sanctions relief as part of any ceasefire deal, as well as Ukrainian territorial concessions. Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov on Saturday stated that "the economic interests of our countries intersect in Alaska and the Arctic, and there are prospects for implementing large-scale and mutually beneficial projects," the Kremlin stated. Portes said that if Trump "had the patience and the willingness to apply sanctions properly, then waiting [to hold talks] would result in a very significant change in the balance of forces." As things stand, however, Trump has mulled but so far held off on increasing sanctions on Russia. Washington has instead threatened the Kremlin's remaining trading partners, such as India, with "secondary sanctions" and additional trade tariffs for continuing with purchases of Russian oil, which have funded Moscow's war machine. Mikhail Metzel | Via Reuters Asked whether Trump could press ahead with more punitive sanctions to push Putin toward a peace deal, Portes asked: "Can anyone predict what the President of the United States will do from one day to the next? 'Win-win' for defense stocks Global financial markets reacted positively to the announcement on Friday that talks to end the war would take place imminently, with bourses in Europe and U.S. But Christopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard, said that the talks could ultimately prove to be a "win-win for European defense stocks" and advised investors to "buy on that weakness." watch now

Article: But Paulson was shocked and flooded with memories when, just two weeks ago, he saw his former friend’s name in the headlines after police found the 34-year-old dead inside his Harlem apartment. Courtesy Joshua Baker When authorities entered the apartment on July 31 after Donald called for help, they found Jacob slumped over his toilet with a gash on his head and multiple stab wounds to the back of his leg, one deep enough to penetrate muscle, according to charging documents. In the days since his death, Paulson and seven others who knew Jacob spoke with NBC News as they slowly learned about the personal trainer’s life over the last decade. And while his fatal stabbing comes as a shock, those who knew Jacob believe Donald cut out his friends — and potential lifelines — years before he truly needed them. Paulson and Baker said that the trio never went “anywhere without each other” and spent endless days cooped up in Jacob’s Hell’s Kitchen apartment, which they say overlooked Central Park, playing video games, eating fried food, and daydreaming about their futures. A prominent New York City drag queen who uses they/them pronouns, Cummings said Jacob would frequently walk them between gigs late at night to make sure they got there safely. Jonathan Starkey, a friend from Texas, recalled that in one conversation around that time, Jacob said that “a lot had changed, and that Donald was a little possessive and jealous and kind of restricted who he was in touch with.” “Jacob wasn’t really someone who let people tell him what to do, which is why it’s so strange,” Starkey said. “He’s decided to break away from his past, which unfortunately included his closest friends, in order to move forward with a healthy life.” “He’s been very focused and is back on the right track in his life and in order to remain focused he will remain out of contact for the moment,” Donald added. For years, the only updates Jacob’s friends received about their friend came through social media, where images from the couple’s Instagrams showed what appeared to be a happy couple who traveled the world and lived a glamorous New York life. Prosecutors said in the charging documents filed after Jacob’s death that Donald had nine domestic incident reports filed against him since 2022, but did not provide more details about the nature of the incidents or who filed them. In November 2024, an order of protection was issued in New York County Criminal Court that directed Donald to cease communication and stay away from Jacob, according to charging documents associated with Donald’s arrest in February. The court records allege that Donald held a knife in Jacob’s direction and said, “I will attack you.” He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is still pending. When police arrived, they found Donald sitting on their couch with three cuts to his arm that later required stitches, a black eye, and bite marks, according to a criminal complaint. However, prosecutors say that Jacob called his father from the bathroom before the attack and allegedly told him that Donald “was coming at him with knives and preventing him from leaving the apartment,” according to the criminal complaint.

Article: It seems President Trump’s meeting with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, which included receiving a gold-and-glass statue from him at the White House last Wednesday, was not his most significant interaction with a top US exec that day. Yesterday, the Financial Times and the New York Times reported that POTUS also met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who offered to give the US 15% of revenue from selling AI chips to China in exchange for…the export licenses required to sell said chips to China. Heart of the deal Nvidia’s agreement revolves around its H20 AI chip, which has been in the news a lot: Nvidia specifically developed it for the Chinese market after President Biden introduced export controls in 2022 to keep more advanced US chips out of China. In July, the Trump administration announced it would allow Nvidia to sell the H20 to China again, but it didn’t grant the licenses for that until the end of last week. The Trump admin also banned exports of it to China in April, and it will receive export licenses again for the same terms, according to both the NYT and the FT. The Commerce Department, the White House, and AMD did not provide comment to the New York Times, but Nvidia Spokesperson Ken Brown told the outlet, “We hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” Big picture: After months of cutting deals with foreign nations about tariff rates for imports coming into the US, Trump negotiating for the government to share revenue with US companies for items going out is unprecedented.—HVL

Article: Ten years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision. Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees. In a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses. More fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was "egregiously wrong." "The mistake must be corrected," wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell "legal fiction." The petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, with son Nathan Davis, a deputy clerk, reads a statement to the media outside the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Ky., on September 14, 2015. Pablo Alcala/Lexington Herald-Leader/Tribune News Service via Getty Image "If there ever was a case of exceptional importance," Staver wrote, "the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it." Lower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk "cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect." Davis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention," said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News. A renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent Davis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy. So far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal. Scott Olson/Getty Images Support for equal marriage rights softening While a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020. The justices "should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell," Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights. "It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now," said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law. "It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement." Ruling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages If the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law. There are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Chief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as "an act of will, not legal judgment" with "no basis in the Constitution." He also warned then that it "creates serious questions about religious liberty." Davis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year.

Article: The plan follows a deliberate sequence: First destroy, then starve, occupy, demand demilitarisation, and finally carry out full ethnic cleansing once Palestinians have no political power and capacity to resist. On Sunday, the Israeli army assassinated Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa by dropping a missile on a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital. Advertisement The footage shocked viewers across the world and so the Israeli government was quick to ban filming on these flights, warning that aid drops would be halted if there were any violations. So before that day arrives, Israel is racing to erase the evidence because once the world sees Gaza, it will no longer be able to pretend that the war was about anything other than the mass killing of Palestinians and the erasure of their history. It has buried massacred civilians in mass graves with bulldozers; it has withheld bodies of Palestinian torture victims; it has dug into the sand whole crime scenes of execution; it has planted weapons in hospitals that it has ransacked; it has lied about discovering tunnels. Some of the documents that have disappeared give gruesome details about the brutality of Zionist fighters during massacres of Palestinians, like in the village of Dawaymeh, near Hebron, where hundreds of Palestinian men, women, and children were killed by artillery fire or directly executed. Journalists thus become mouthpieces for the Israeli military, parroting their justifications for wholesale destruction and propagating their lies about Palestinian civilians as “human shields” and Gaza hospitals and schools as “terror hubs”. Israel used this strategy early into the genocide, dropping leaflets warning Palestinians in northern Gaza that they will be deemed “partners in a terrorist organisation” if they do not comply with “evacuation orders”. Germany went as far as halting military exports that could be used in Gaza – something that should have been done 22 months ago, when Israel started indiscriminately bombing civilians. It must undertake military intervention, as mandated under international law, to force Israel to immediately end the violence, to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to give Palestinians the freedom they are entitled to.

Article: Below are a few of the responses to the killing of Al Jazeera staff: Palestine The Palestinian mission to the United Nations accused Israel of “deliberately assassinating” al-Sharif and Qreiqeh, describing them as among the “last remaining journalists” in Gaza. “As Israel continues to ethnically cleanse Gaza, its enemy remains the truth: the brave journalists exposing its heinous crimes.” Iran Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei has called on the world to hold Israel to account after the killing of the five Al Jazeera staff. “In Gaza, and everywhere, media workers should be able to carry out their work freely and without harassment, intimidation or fear of being targeted.” Al Jazeera Media Network Al Jazeera Media Network has condemned “in the strongest terms” the killing of its journalists in a targeted assassination by Israeli forces. The strike came amid what Al Jazeera described as the “catastrophic consequences” of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, including mass civilian deaths, forced starvation, and the destruction of entire communities. “This is part of a pattern … going back decades, in which it kills journalists.” Amnesty International Amnesty International condemned the strike as a war crime under international law and remembered al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter. At great risk to their lives, they have remained to show the world the war crimes being committed by Israel against almost two million Palestinian women, men and children,” he added. National Press Club Mike Balsamo, president of the US-based National Press Club, said the killing of journalists is “a loss felt far beyond one newsroom” and urged a “thorough and transparent” investigation. “All parties in conflict zones must honour their obligations under international law to protect reporters and ensure they can carry out their work safely.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned Israel’s killing of five Al Jazeera journalists and called on US and international media workers to “stand in solidarity” with their Palestinian colleagues. “The murder of these Al Jazeera journalists is not an accident or collateral damage – it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) — India ’s opposition parties held a protest Monday calling for the rollback of a controversial revision of the voter list in one of the country’s poorest states, where key elections are scheduled in November, and warning it could lead to voter disenfranchisement. Hundreds of lawmakers and supporters began the protest from parliament and were confronted by police, who stopped them from marching towards the election commission office in the capital, New Delhi. India's opposition accuses the Election Commission of India of rushing through a mammoth electoral roll revision in eastern Bihar state, saying the exercise could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. The revision of nearly 80 million voters involves strict documentation requirements from citizens, triggering concerns it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, especially those who are unable to produce the paperwork required to prove their citizenship. The election agency has denied the allegations and said it has ensured no eligible voter is “left behind." It has also said the “intensive revision” is a routine update to ensure the accuracy of electoral rolls and is needed to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants." According to the commission, some 49.6 million voters whose names were included in a similar exercise in 2003 are not required to submit any further documents. Modi's BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. Critics and opposition leaders have warned that the exercise is similar to that of a controversial 2019 citizenship list in India's eastern Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness. Gandhi, the opposition leader, made public last week his Congress Party's analysis from southern Karnataka state that alleged nearly 100,000 votes cast for an assembly seat in the 2024 general election were fraudulent.

(AP Photo/Abdul Rehman) GILGIT, Pakistan -- A massive mudslide early Monday killed seven volunteers as they repaired a drainage channel damaged by flash floods in northern Pakistan, officials said, leaving three others injured. Rescuers recovered the bodies after the mudslide hit the town of Danyor in Gilgit-Baltistan at dawn and transported the injured to a hospital, said Faizullah Faraq, a regional government spokesperson. This came a day after a flash flood triggered by a glacial lake outburst damaged the key Karakoram Highway, which passes through Danyor, disrupting traffic and trade between Pakistan and China.

Article: The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest maritime routes, which Beijing claims almost entirely despite an international ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. “The China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” Gan Yu, a Chinese coastguard spokesperson, said in a statement. “The [Chinese coastguard vessel] CCG 3104, which was chasing the [Philippine coastguard vessel] BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the [Philippine] vessel’s starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] Navy warship,” spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country’s patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend and exercise Manila’s sovereign rights over what it considers to be part of its territory. Marcos also addressed another source of tension with Beijing, stating China has “misinterpreted” his recent comments saying Manila would be inevitably drawn into a conflict between China and Taiwan should one erupt. China accused Marcos of “playing with fire” after the Philippine leader said during a visit to India that “there is no way that the Philippines can stay out of it” due to its proximity to Taiwan.

County’s Emergency Centralized Response Center launched in January with a goal of better coordinating the various efforts among different government agencies and nonprofits to clean encampments, get people healthcare and into temporary or permanent housing. The dispatch center was established following a request from Supervisors Horvath and Kathryn Barger and is part of a larger stated effort to increase accountability and coordination when it comes to homeless services, including a new county homeless department that will launch next year. Advertisement In the supervisors’ motion requesting the response center, they said there previously wasn’t one entity tasked “to oversee and direct daily operations for unhoused individuals across Los Angeles County” — no small problem when different county departments, federal agencies, state agencies and 88 cities are involved. (David Butow/For The Times) When an encampment popped up, officials said multiple agencies would receive requests for service and then act on their own, resulting in multiple outreach teams dispatched to the same location, without knowledge someone else had been there before. Sometimes, a state agency would clean an encampment on its property, but not notify the local agency that owned the adjacent property, allowing residents to move their encampment there, said Donald Holt, principal analyst with ECRC. Now, the county says ECRC overseas more than 150 outreach teams across 11 organizations and coordinates with multiple government agencies that offer housing and conduct cleanups to ensure they are working together. “It wasn’t until this center came together that that coordination was really put into action in the ways we all expected.” Based in an office at the downtown Hall of Administration, center staff handle requests for service from elected officials, the public and government agencies and then coordinate cleanups and work to find housing, as well as needed medical care. (David Butow/For The Times) In addition to eight analysts dedicated to managing requests for specific regions of the county, workers at the center include staff from the county’s Housing for Health, Department of Mental Health, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the Department of Military & Veterans Affair, among others. “That would have taken me six hours.” Advertisement On a recent Tuesday, staff started the day in a meeting where they updated one another on requests for service, including instances where people were successfully moved into housing and others where the effort was still underway. (David Franco/County of Los Angeles) Shortly after the meeting, Chung’s supervisor Lisa Speights stopped by the cubicle of Maribel Lozano-Hernandez with the county’s Housing for Health program to discuss a housing request that came in within the last 24 hours. Three weeks ago , outreach workers from LA Family Housing, arrived to speak with residents, remind them of the following day’s cleanup and encourage them to sign forms to get into housing. (County of Los Angeles) Outreach workers had already been on site around five times and had already located housing options for some of the people living in roughly 10 tents and makeshift structures. Residents Jose Duran and his partner Melanie Morales said they moved onto the streets a few months ago when they couldn’t pay rent after Duran fell from a three story building and could no longer work construction. Speaking as trains zoomed past, Duran said after he fell from a ladder, his foot became infected and he received skin grafts to fix it, but still needs another surgery. According to a county spokesperson, workers removed “four makeshift shelters or tents and ten cubic yards of debris.” Duran and Morales weren’t housed that day and said they were told there wasn’t beds currently available. Rachel Kassenbrock, the county spokesperson, said on the day of the cleanup ten people from the encampment weren’t immediately able to be housed, but put on a wait list until beds became available, including Duran and Morales.

Article: For months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools. The morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.” Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom’s comments and legal threat. Advertisement The developments bring the fight over America’s higher education institutions — which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months — to the nation’s most powerful and lauded public university system. And what role will money — taxpayer money — play?” California is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls “Marxist” universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars. Advertisement His administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide — Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses — of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.” What’s at stake Since July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions — totaling nearly half a billion dollars — UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy. Advertisement UCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said. They hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations. The NSF letter said that UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.” What Trump wants Federal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations. The settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments. “It’s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words ‘UCLA.’ ” What comes next The 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC. Advertisement In an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were “clearly illegal” because “the president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.” He outlined what would likely be California’s argument in a suit: The government’s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized. “Agencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are ‘arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.’ Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.” Negotiations still possible But California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration’s orders. When Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over. California “might do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don’t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.” Advertisement After Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table — but not on the current “unacceptable” terms. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. The fact that UC is a public university system adds to the complexities.” Mitchell, the American Council on Education president and former top administrator of Occidental College, said a quick resolution would benefit both sides. He said a months-long process — as it’s been between Harvard and Trump — would have the potential for “great harm.” “These things, the longer they go on, the worse they get,” he said.

Article: Less than a week after he responded to a disappointing jobs report by firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Trump showed reporters a handful of charts with data he liked much more. This combination limits policymakers’ options: Most tools to fight inflation (such raising interest rates) risk hurting economic growth, while most tools to boost growth (such as increased government spending) risk increasing inflation. At the same time, in addition to the slowing pace of job creation, GDP growth averaged 1.3% for the first half of the year, down sharply from the last couple years. Graham wrote, “some peculiar views about women, both related and unrelated to the economy.” The issue in his record most relevant to Thursday’s presentation is Moore’s relationship with the truth.

Article: There’s a genre of conspiracy theory that goes like this: A politician, faced with a particularly uncomfortable or embarrassing scandal, manufactures another story — a distraction — to divert attention and alleviate pressure on themselves. In 1998, congressional Republicans suggested President Bill Clinton had deployed missiles to Sudan and Afghanistan to change the subject away from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which he had admitted to three days earlier. — known for his anti-vaccine congressional hearings and a backyard watermelon ballistics test aimed at proving a former White House aide’s suicide was actually a murder — said at the time, “I’d hate to think this was a ‘Wag the Dog’ type thing,” referencing the 1997 dark comedy in which a president fabricates a war with Albania to distract from a sex scandal. At gaggles, in interviews and on his social media platform, he has made explicit his desire to shift attention away from Jeffrey Epstein — the disgraced financier found dead from suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. As a reminder, in July, Epstein again took over the national narrative when the Department of Justice, after months spent dangling the promise of new revelations, published a memo stating that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted, there was no client list to pursue and that Epstein had, in fact, killed himself. Mainstream press took up the subject, too, in coverage that revealed new details of the friendship between Epstein and Trump and followed the fight for the release of the so-called Epstein files as was being called for by a strange new consortium of Democrats, MAGA followers and some of Epstein’s victims. In the weeks since, Trump has openly attempted to redirect the national conversation, insisting people focus instead on flooding in Texas, or America’s success, or most recently, the revival of a familiar conspiracy theory: that Obama and the intelligence community framed Russia for interfering in the 2016 election all in an effort to undermine Trump’s presidency. “People should really focus on how well the country is doing, or they should focus on the fact that Barack Hussein Obama led a coup,” Trump said in July, when asked about Epstein. spy agencies to manufacture a narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf — a “hoax” the current president has railed against for years, claiming it was orchestrated to undermine him. Gabbard announced on July 18 that she had found evidence of “a treasonous conspiracy,” that the Obama administration “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Trump.” The Russiagate rollout has been a slow burn. After her initial claim on July 18 came the release of a declassified 5-year-old Republican House Intelligence Committee report on July 23, a whistleblower twist on July 30, the release of a formerly classified annex on July 31, and finally, reports that Attorney General Pam Bondi had launched a grand jury investigation based on Gabbard’s reports, targeting not just Obama, but also his former directors of national intelligence, the CIA and the FBI. Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement the claims were “outrageous,” “bizarre” and “a weak attempt at distraction.” The New York Times reported the newly declassified documents, in fact, disproved Gabbard’s allegations, noting the emails presented as smoking guns by right-wing media were almost certainly fabrications made by Russian spies. The Bulwark’s Cathy Young called the releases “a nothingburger.” And Renée DiResta, an associate research professor at Georgetown and a contributing editor at Lawfare, likened it to an attack “by document — flooding the zone with memos and annexes most people on X will never read, relying instead on influencers and partisan media to shape the narrative for them.” Multiple investigations — including a 2017 Intelligence Community assessment, special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report, a 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee review and special counsel John Durham’s 2023 report — have all concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Trump. None of the inquiries, including Durham’s, which was tasked with looking for it, has ever presented evidence of a plot by Obama administration officials to sabotage Trump or to fabricate intelligence. The same evening Gabbard made her announcement, mentions of Epstein among right-wing influencers on X dropped off, according to data compiled by University of Washington professor and disinformation expert Kate Starbird. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to let the Epstein Files go, because there’s justice that needs to be served there,” said Liz Wheeler, a MAGA podcaster who was among the first and loudest critics of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein affair. “But something bigger broke since then, and it’s been more important to us for a long time.” Wheeler, who was among a handful of influencers invited to the White House in February and photographed holding binders of already-public Epstein documents, said the new Russiagate investigation didn’t distract her — it confirmed that Trump was listening to his base and delivering on their demands for justice, of some kind. Longtime conspiracy theory researcher Travis View, co-host of the “QAnon Anonymous” podcast and a producer at Cursed Media, said that even the most Epstein-obsessed, conspiracy-addled faction of MAGA had been pulled in by Gabbard’s revelations. He can promise a special investigation and keep people in perpetual suspense of the big reveal that never comes.” Trump’s pivot to Russiagate, View said, is a cleaner narrative — especially given his uncomfortable association with Epstein. For those of us who still believe in quaint ideas like karma or shame — the regular folks forced to face the consequences of our own actions — it’s maddening to watch as Trump once again seems poised to slip free from another mess of his own making. While the MAGA outrage has shifted — away from Trump and Epstein, and onto a narrative with familiar bad guys and less of the mess — the mainstream press won’t let go. “It’s put out by the Democrats because we’ve had the most successful six months in the history of our country, and that’s just a way of trying to divert attention to something that’s total bullshit, OK?”

Article: Texas Legislature to take another swing at redistricting vote as Democrats extend their walkout Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. "If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on "Fox News Sunday." When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate - such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California - Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. "They know that they're going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they're trying to steal seats," Pritzker said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful." President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful than it ever was before." "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump wrote Sunday. We're going to put you in jail where you belong." Last week the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option "to extend as needed." On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was "ridiculous" and the city was "unsafe," after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. "I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard," she said Sunday on MSNBC's "The Weekend," acknowledging it is "the president's call about how to deploy the Guard." Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as "one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, "Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false." Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are all down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Trump offered no details in Truth Social posts over the weekend about possible new actions to address crime levels that he argues are dangerous for citizens, tourists and workers alike. The president criticized the district as full of "tents, squalor, filth, and Crime," and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. The president called Bowser "a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances." Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: Brown | AFP | Getty Images On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the "electric vehicle mandate" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax-and-spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives. Despite the automaker touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000. Jacobson said last month that GM has an "inherent advantage" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings. Ford Motor Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's July 30 call with analysts that it has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation "pretty massively" as a result of softer regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

Article: Netanyahu defends new military offensive in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel "has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a "targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign." Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his "steadfast support." Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a "global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to "bring in more foreign journalists" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. "But I have no other choice to feed the kids." Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: "There were no incidents at or near our sites today." Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said artificial general intelligence, or "AGI," is losing its relevance as a term as rapid advances in the space make it harder to define the concept. "I think it's not a super useful term," Altman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. The AI entrepreneur has previously said he thinks AGI could be developed in the "reasonably close-ish future." The problem with AGI, Altman said, is that there are multiple definitions being used by different companies and individuals. One definition is an AI that can do "a significant amount of the work in the world," according to Altman — however, that has its issues because the nature of work is constantly changing. "I think the point of all of this is it doesn't really matter and it's just this continuing exponential of model capability that we'll rely on for more and more things," Altman said.

Article: The president said the subject of news conference will "not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." The event comes a week after the president again threatened a federal takeover of D.C. In recent days, the president boosted the federal law enforcement presence in D.C., which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt framed as a "first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, DC." Trump also has the authority to take control of the local police, but Congress would need to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which granted D.C. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said in an MSNBC interview yesterday that she thinks Trump will announce he is surging federal law enforcement in the capital and pushed back on the assertion that D.C. “If the priority is to show force in an American city, we know [Trump] can do that here, but it won’t be because there’s a spike in crime,” Bowser said. The president said on Truth Social that he would also discuss plans to make the district "more beautiful than it ever was before," which would include removing homeless people from the city. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." In a separate post to Truth Social, Trump indicated he would also focus on "the Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." He then referred to the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, which he has previously criticized, saying it "could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner" for far less money.

Article: As people rushed to help, it became apparent that five Al Jazeera staff had been killed, including Anas al-Sharif, one of the most famous faces of Arabic reporting from Gaza. The tent was where they worked, as journalists in Gaza have gathered at hospitals to seek better electricity and internet connections, a fact that has been well-known since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza. “I’m not far from al-Shifa Hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa Hospital,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported yesterday. “I could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa Hospital.” What happened? Shortly before being killed, al-Sharif wrote on X that Israel had launched intense, concentrated bombardment – also known as “fire belts” – on the eastern and southern parts of Gaza City. “[I thought] all our colleagues were martyred.” Al-Sultan added that he wasn’t sure who the journalists were who were in the tent, but “when I started filming, I saw our colleagues Anas al-Sharif was on the ground and Mohammed Qreiqeh, who was on fire. “We started to pull him out and try to put out the fire.” The people gathered there tried to get Qreiqeh inside al-Shifa Hospital, but he succumbed to his wounds before they could get him treatment, al-Sultan said. Israel’s army posted about deliberately killing the journalists, claiming it had wanted to kill al-Sharif, who it accused of being an armed commander for Hamas only posing as a journalist. Two of the most prominent incidents included journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh, and journalist Hossam Shabat, who were both assassinated by Israel and accused of being members of Hamas without any evidence. Israel has banned international media from entering Gaza since October 2023, but “Al Jazeera journalists remained within besieged Gaza … [delivering] searing eyewitness accounts of the horrors unleashed over 22 months of relentless bombing and destruction,” the statement said. Israel ramped up a smear campaign on al-Sharif in recent months, with army spokesperson Avichay Adraee calling out al-Sharif by name in a video on X last month, accusing him of being part of Hamas’s military wing.

"Our sense is that CoreWeave's opportunities are going to get bigger and lumpier, likely to the surprise of investors, though we are not making a specific call on the upcoming Q2 results as it is likely a futile exercise to speculate on the closing of specific deals and investors should in fact expect extreme lumpiness in CoreWeave's pattern of large bookings," the analyst wrote in a note dated Sunday. "Although timing and lumpiness still give us pause and create extreme volatility, we are positive on the potential for continued momentum in CoreWeave's business pipeline, and our field work suggests long-range potential for binary-outcome transactions which are very difficult to handicap and, if successful, can drive a very surprising magnitude of outsized growth and outsized debt financing with short-term cash burn," Murphy said.

Article: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person overnight as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit between Putin and Trump. KYIV, Ukraine -- A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two more in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, the region's governor said Monday, as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit meeting in which Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to persuade his U.S. A Ukrainian official said at least four drones launched by the country's security services, or SBU, struck a plant in the city of Arzamas that produced components for the Khinzal 32 and Khinzal 101 missiles. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an "absolutely legitimate target" because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Donald Trump will host in Alaska later this week, sees Putin unwavering on his maximalist demands to keep all the Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy but also to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO with the long-term aim to keep the country under Moscow's sphere of influence. Spokesman Steffen Meyer reiterated that the German government "has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate "independently and autonomously." Meanwhile on the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war, other than a brief respite before Moscow resumes its attacks with even greater might.

Congress is starting to ask questions FILE - Federal agents escort a family to a transport bus after they were detained following an appearance at immigration court, July 22, 2025, in San Antonio, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) FILE - Federal agents escort a family to a transport bus after they were detained following an appearance at immigration court, July 22, 2025, in San Antonio, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House's border security and mass deportation agenda. The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget. The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.” The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said. But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall. “We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated" through the new law. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.” All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.” As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

Article: President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is "the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority. The militant group lost most of its territory in Iraq in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019 when it lost the last sliver of land it controlled in east Syria.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl. But he said Trump “hasn't made any firm decisions.” Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them.

Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Iran's Foreign Ministry says talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency will be "technical" and "complicated." Iran says talks with IAEA will be 'technical' and 'complicated' ahead of agency's planned visit TEHRAN -- Talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will be “technical” and "complicated," the Islamic Republic’s Foreign Ministry said Monday ahead of a visit by the nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with the organization last month. Esmail Baghaei, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters there could be a meeting with Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks.” Baghaei also criticized the IAEA's “unique situation” during the June war with Israel. "Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Aragchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. intelligence agencies and the IAEA had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Peruvian President Dina Boluarte met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Monday during a visit aimed at strengthening economic ties as the two countries look to expand into new markets amid geopolitical challenges and rising trade barriers. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May 2024 on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. “The CEPA is a testament to the determination of our governments to promote freer trade and strengthen our economies,” Boluarte said in a joint news conference with Subianto after the meeting, adding that the deal can promoting the exchange of goods and laying the foundations for future agreements. Boluarte said Indonesia has become a key partner for Peru in Southeast Asia, and said her visit to the fourth most populous country in the world and one of the most dynamic emerging economies in Asia was an excellent moment to reaffirm their commitment to full observance of international law, free trade, South-South cooperation, food security and sustainable development. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” said Indonesia's trade minister, Budi Santoso, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry's data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

MILWAUKEE (WLS) -- Milwaukee County was under a state of emergency Sunday as several roads were blocked off and neighbors impacted by flooding tried to salvage what's left after what's being called a historic rainfall. The city of Milwaukee and its surrounding suburbs were still trying to dry out Sunday night after getting hit with more than a foot of water from a historic rainfall that caused flash flooding, taking many by surprise. "We were up 2, 3 in the morning outside just watching it creep closer and closer and then recede, so we were one of the fortunate ones." Thousands of other Milwaukee County residents were not so lucky The night of the storm, sewers were operating in reverse, pushing out flood waters into people's yards. The Milwaukee Fire Department said emergency responders were inundated with 911 calls, responding to more than 600 calls for help from Saturday night up until Sunday morning, including dozens of water rescues. "We're seeing reports from some parts of the city that have received more than a foot of rain, more than a foot of rain in a very short period of time, this flooding event, it's very significant, something that Milwaukee hasn't seen in perhaps a decade or more," Milwaukee Mayor Chevy Johnson said.

Article: In late January, just two days after his second presidential inaugural, Donald Trump told Russia that if it failed to end its war in Ukraine quickly, the White House “would have no other choice” but to impose new economic sanctions. Nearly two weeks ago, on July 29, the American president brought new specificity to his threat, telling reporters that Putin’s regime had just 10 days to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine — the neighboring country it invaded three years ago — or the United States would impose new economic penalties on Russia. Those who predicted that Trump was serious — this time would be different from all of those other times; this time Putin had gone too far and earned the American president’s contempt — were predictably wrong. NBC News reported: Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Complicating matters further, the Republican announced that he was welcoming Putin to American soil — the two are now scheduled to meet in Alaska on Friday — handing Moscow a related diplomatic coup. (Because the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children, the Russian dictator generally hasn’t been able to travel outside of his own country. The American president nevertheless invited him to the U.S.) Just days earlier, the official White House line was that Trump was willing to meet with the Russian leader, but only if Putin agreed to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump not only abandoned his own sanctions deadline (again), not only invited Putin onto American soil in exchange for nothing, and not only gave an international pariah the legitimacy he craves, he also took some time at a White House event on Friday to assure the world that Putin “wants to see peace.” Russia’s war — which has intensified during Trump’s second term — clearly proves otherwise, and Trump himself has repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that Putin most certainly does not want peace. At the same White House event on Friday afternoon, the American president also suggested that Ukraine might have to agree to let Russia keep some of the Ukrainian territory that the Russian military took by force. is “done with the funding of the Ukraine war business.” And around the same time, Matthew Whitaker, the administration’s unfortunate NATO ambassador, suggested on CNN that Russia would likely be rewarded with Ukrainian territory it “earned on the battlefield.” About a month ago, after Trump teased a “major statement” about U.S. Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at Kings College London, told the Times, “It has been a very good week for Putin.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point, though I’d add that with Trump in the White House, it’s been a very good seven months for Putin, too.

The opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, claims the ruling party and the election commission are jointly manipulating elections through obscure additions and deletions to voter rolls. The issue gained momentum after a sudden revision of voter rolls ahead of elections in Bihar, the eastern state of over 130 million that is expected to elect its local government in November. Modi’s party said was to clear the rolls of “infiltrators.” But the opposition sees it as a way of disenfranchising the state’s Muslim voters and other blocs hostile to their Hindu nationalist policies.

The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

At the time, there was no suggestion that the resumption of sales to China would come with conditions or any kind of revenue forfeiture, and the step was celebrated by markets because of the billions of dollars worth of potential sales to China that were back on the table.

Article: Under CEO Matt Baer, a former Walmart and Macy's executive who was tapped to helm the business in June 2023, Stitch Fix posted its first revenue growth in 12 straight quarters for the three months ended May 3. The company, which charges a $20 styling fee for all "fixes" it sends, saw revenue per active client grow to $542 during its most recent quarter, up 3% from the year-ago period. "It's been really affirming to us that, you know, with this return to growth, with this increase in engagement, with this increase in average order value, that we do have the right strategy," Baer told CNBC in an interview. "We've got the right team and we're executing against it at a high level as well." Stitch Fix hasn't posted an annual profit since 2019 but for three straight quarters, its year-over-year losses have narrowed. To be sure, Stitch Fix's sales growth in its fiscal third quarter was modest, up just 0.7%, but it expects those gains to continue in its current quarter with sales projected to be flat to up 1.7% year over year. The rise and fall Retail and restaurant consultant Katrina Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 with the mission to combine data with personalized styling to develop a shopping experience that actually felt individualized at scale. In a world where shoppers regularly groan about the banality of modern-day shopping, Stitch Fix sought to be the panacea by offering accessible personal stylists that could design and ship outfits specific to a customer's unique needs and preferences. Source: Nasdaq But then the market grew crowded and suddenly, customers found themselves overwhelmed by all of the companies looking to sell them a monthly subscription box, whether it was a package of clothes, beauty products or dog treats. In January 2023, StitchFix announced that CEO Elizabeth Spaulding would be stepping down and Lake would return to the helm as its interim CEO and lead the search process for a new top executive. But Baer's career in retail started long before that: At 16, he started working in his family business, Baer's Furniture & Interior Design, a small chain of furniture stores dotted along the Florida coasts and founded by his great-grandfather in 1945. I was able to understand their needs and translate that into an exceptional service that we could provide." Matt Baer, CEO of Stitch Fix Courtesy: Stitch Fix Baer said his first order of business after taking over at Stitch Fix was to understand the company's primary client and how that shopper was experiencing the service. In Stitch Fix's early days, customers had one option – five items in a box at a recurring cadence with one discount mechanism – but these days, there's less rigidity. Customers can order a fix on demand, opt in for regular deliveries or shop through Stitch Fix's "freestyle" catalog, which allows them to instantly select and buy pieces based on their style profile. With no physical retail presence, Stitch Fix's online customer acquisition is expensive and the company has to manage the headaches of packing individual boxes and then processing the stream of free returns that come when clients don't like the items that came with their fix. Courtesy: Stitch Fix Another primary area of focus was adjusting Stitch Fix's assortment and revamping its private brand portfolio, which comes at a higher margin and makes up between 40% and 50% of sales, according to Stich Fix. More than two years into his tenure, Baer said he's still attending monthly client focus groups and styling fixes for customers "nearly every day," which he said allows him to stay close to customers. "One client, she lives in Letcher, South Dakota, population 159, and it's only because of Stitch Fix that she has access to these brands, that she has the ability to wear product and clothes that are differentiated, unique and special within her community," said Baer. "That feels great when I give her that confidence, when I'm able to create that joy for her." More work ahead Stitch Fix's turnaround comes at a difficult time for the apparel industry. Shoppers are more selective than ever with their discretionary dollars, and Stitch Fix's $20 styling fee can feel unnecessary when customers can purchase many of the same items the retailer offers right off the rack and directly from the brand. In a June research note, financial firm Mizuho Securities said Stitch Fix's growth in average order value is expected to dissipate in fiscal 2026 as it laps its expansion into larger fixes. "While management attributed outsized growth to more opportunistic spend and some natural investment cycle, we caution whether it's becoming more expensive to keep the active customer base engaged," Mizuho analyst David Bellinger wrote.

Article: Dame Stephanie 'Steve' Shirley, technology pioneer, dies aged 91 27 minutes ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman • @zsk Technology editor Share Save AFP via Getty Images Visionary tech pioneer and philanthropist Dame Stephanie Shirley has died at the age of 91. The boundary-breaking entrepreneur arrived in London at the age of five, just weeks before the outbreak of World War Two, and went on to become a computer industry and women's rights pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s. She founded the software company Freelance Programmers in 1962, which shook up the tech industry by almost exclusively hiring women, and in later life donated almost £70m to help those with autism and to IT projects. He had hoped that being in a position of power would protect his family, but as the Nazi government increased its persecution of German Jews, they fled to the Austrian capital Vienna. She was one of thousands of Jewish children fleeing the Nazis and came to Britain as part of the Kindertransport - a British rescue effort in the months preceding World War 2 which brought 10,000 children to the UK - where she was brought up by loving foster parents. Dame Stephanie Shirley Dame Stephanie (left) and her sister, pictured with their German father and Austrian mother, who put them on a Kindertransport train to escape Nazi-occupied Austria Determined not to be defined by her traumatic childhood, Dame Stephanie founded a company designed to provide jobs for women with children. After starting out as a scientific civil servant, in 1962 she founded software company Freelance Programmers - later known as FI Group, later still Xansa - something which was almost unheard of for a woman to do in the 1960s. Her late son Giles was autistic and she was an early member of the National Autistic Society, with her charity the Shirley Foundation funding many projects particularly related to autism.

Article: During a recent “expletive-laden address” at the Army War College, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted, “We are laser-focused on our mission of warfighting.” The former Fox News host did not, however, specify which war, exactly, he’s eager to win. The beleaguered Pentagon chief doesn’t even seem especially embarrassed about his culture-war focus, boasting on Fox News last week that he’s focused of late on things like “statues” and “paintings.” How do these efforts advance the nation’s national security goals? Late last week, Hegseth also used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. While it’s important to emphasize that Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, he nevertheless thought it’d be a good idea to promote the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” What’s more, the secretary’s office didn’t make much of an effort to distance himself from the video Hegseth amplified. Four days into Donald Trump’s second term, 50 Senate Republicans overlooked Hegseth’s record and radicalism and confirmed him to serve in one of the most important and powerful positions in the United States government.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city’s mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” Ahead of that news conference, Trump said Monday on social media that the nation’s capital would “LIBERATED today!” He said he would end the “days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move also comes as he has sought to consolidate more of society’s power under the White House in ways that raise fundamental questions about how the federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s military targeted and killed an Al Jazeera correspondent and others with an airstrike late Sunday in Gaza, after press advocates said an Israeli “smear campaign” stepped up when Anas al-Sharif cried on air over starvation in the territory. READ MORE: Netanyahu defends military expansion in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Both Israel and hospital officials in Gaza City confirmed the deaths of al-Sharif and colleagues, which the Committee to Protect Journalists and others described as retribution against those documenting the war in Gaza. The airstrike came less than a year after Israeli army officials first accused al-Sharif and other Al Jazeera journalists of being members of the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike a “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif’s death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. WATCH: Netanyahu lashes out at critics of plan to occupy Gaza City as condemnation mounts Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The U.N. human rights office on Monday condemned Sunday’s airstrike targeting the journalists’ tent “in grave breach of international humanitarian law.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 journalists have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Funeral-goers call to protect journalists Al-Sharif reported a nearby bombardment minutes before his death. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group’s regional director, said in a statement.

Article: Finnish authorities say they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia FILE - The Cook Islands-registered oil tanker Eagle S is anchored near the Kilpilahti port in Porvoo on the Gulf of Finland, Dec. (Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva via AP, File) HELSINKI -- Finnish authorities said Monday they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia. The Finnish deputy prosecutor general said in a statement that charges of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications were filed against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union’s executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Monday's statement alleges that “the Eagle S, which left Russia’s Ust-Luga with a cargo of oil products, is suspected of cutting five submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland by dragging its anchor on the seabed for about 90 kilometers (56 miles)." Prosecutors said the owners of the cables have suffered a total of at least 60 million euros ($69.7 million) in repair costs. It added that the defendants "consider that Finland lacks jurisdiction in the case, as the locations of the cable damages are outside Finnish territorial waters.” The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of Estonia's electricity needs in winter, did not disrupt service, although it drove up energy prices in the Baltic nations.

A federal judge in New York on Monday rejected a request by the Justice Department to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted procurer for notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department sought the unsealing of grand jury material related to Maxwell and Epstein after harsh criticism of the Trump administration's decision not to publicly release the investigative file on Epstein. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer quoted a 1973 legal decision which said that "the policy that 'proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret' is 'older than our Nation itself.'

CEO Adam Aron said the company's results are indicative of a "recovering industry-wide box office" after previously struggling to pare losses amid dual writers' and actors' strikes and an overall post-pandemic decline in movie attendance. "In so doing, we have put in place a solid foundation to capitalize on what we believe will be our industry's continued growth momentum, especially evident in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continuing deep into 2026." Aron also said the company saw consolidated admissions revenue per patron topping $12 for "the first time ever," with total consolidated revenue per patron reaching an "unprecedented" $22.26. "The combination of a resurgent box office, our unparalleled theatre footprint with premium experiences galore, our compelling marketing programs and our increasing financial strength have a flywheel impact when they all are happening simultaneously," Aron said.

Article: It's natural to feel like being a good investor means coming up with a complicated strategy that maximizes returns, Morgan Housel, author of "The Psychology of Money," said on a recent episode of The Burnouts podcast. But when it comes to investing, "the more complicated you make it, the worse you're probably going to do." Instead of chasing hot stocks or trying to time the market, the smartest approach to investing is making it as "brainless and simple and boring as you can," Housel said. "If you can be an average investor for an above-average period of time, like just earn average market returns every year for the next 20 years, you'll do amazing," Housel said. "The simple people who can be simple and average for 50 years are the ones who end up doing the best." One of the best tools for this approach is a low-cost index fund, which tracks a market index like the S&P 500 and aims to replicate its performance. Considering that even the world's most seasoned money managers struggle to consistently beat their benchmark indexes, investing to merely keep pace with the market is a savvy, low-effort approach, says Ben Smith, a certified financial planner and founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You don't have to pick and choose different stocks and be really strategic, because that often doesn't work out very well, at least for most investors."

Article: Trial to start on whether deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles violated federal law A federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed troops to Los Angeles. SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California "to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer." MORE: Another 1,350 National Guard troops being withdrawn from Los Angeles, Pentagon says The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can't second guess the president's decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act "fail as a matter of law." They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country "is invaded," when "there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government," or when the president is otherwise unable "to execute the laws of the United States." Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles "fall far short of 'rebellion.'" "Next week's trial is not cancelled," he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

"Its entire premise—that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them—is demonstrably false," Engelmayer wrote. He said the materials provide no new insight into Epstein or Maxwell clients, nor new information about the venue, new sources of their wealth, or the circumstances of Epstein's death. They promised transparency on the Epstein matter, but in July the Justice Department and FBI released a memo that knocked down several of those theories and said no further materials from the Epstein investigations would be made public, touching off public outrage including from Trump's MAGA base . In an effort to contain the fallout, the president, who knew Epstein, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts from the department's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell.

Article: AOL is set to shut down its dial-up internet service, ending more than three decades of the iconic symphony of beeps, screeches and static that once signaled your gateway to the World Wide Web. As a result, on September 30, 2025, this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued," the company said. Though the sluggish internet service may seem like a relic of the 1990s and early 2000s, nearly 160,000 people connect to the internet through their landline telephone service, according to 2023 data from the U.S. The acquisition, valued at $350 billion, was considered one of the biggest media mergers in history and came at the height of the "Internet bubble." The merger failed miserably due to cultural clashes between the companies and the decline of AOL's business model, leading to record losses for both companies.

Article: Rapists 'probably' forfeit right to choose gender - Sturgeon 29 minutes ago Share Save Angus Cochrane BBC News Share Save ITV News questioned the former SNP leader on the political and personal revelations in her book. The former first minister, in an interview with ITV to mark the release of her memoir, also said she was partly to blame for the debate on gender recognition laws in Scotland losing "all sense of rationality". Spindrift Isla Bryson jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape It led to a change in policy so that all newly-convicted or remanded transgender prisoners are initially placed in jails according to their birth sex. "I think what I would say now is that anybody who commits the most heinous male crime against women probably forfeits the right to be the gender of their choice." When pressed about that comment, she added it was "probably was not the best phrase to use". "I should have taken a step back and said, 'How do we achieve this?"' SNP MSP Michelle Thomson, who along with Conservative MSP Russell Findlay proposed an amendment to the gender recognition bill that would have halted gender recognition certificates being given to rapists, said Sturgeon's comments came "too late". "Had she stopped to consider or engage with concerns regarding women's existing rights she would not have forced the SNP group to vote against my amendment to temporarily pause the granting of GRCs to rapists. "For that reason I think that Nicola should really apologise for her failure to listen and act on the views of others." PA Media Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond fell out after the 2014 referendum Sturgeon's memoir, Frankly, will be published on Thursday. Findlay, now Scottish Tory leader, said: "Frankly, Nicola Sturgeon must be delusional if she thinks the women of Scotland will swallow this drivel." He added: "Her absurd ideological belief in self-ID collapses with her belated mealy-mouthed admission that this rapist is a man, but she still can't bring herself to say sorry for all the pain and misery she has caused." Sturgeon also reflected on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, when she campaigned for Yes while serving as deputy first minister to Alex Salmond. "I knew I was going to have to sit him down and say, 'look, you're going to have to read this, and you're going to have to tell me now if there are bits you want to change, because it has to be signed off'. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." He died aged 69 in October. He said Salmond "had spent several years guiding SNP policy to form the basis of a credible case for independence on the back of having ran the most competent government in the history of Scotland". McEleny added: "Nicola's upset that Alex went on a trade mission and left her to complete a task she was responsible for sums up her lack of personal political accountability."

That is some of the reaction to news that two of the world's tech giants will pay the US government 15% of their revenue from selling certain advanced chips to China. But developing them was the only option for accessing the significant Chinese market after the previous administration of President Joe Biden banned US companies from exporting the most advanced chips to China because of national security concerns. More importantly, what message does it send to other US companies that see China as a key market or supplier - from Apple and Tesla to the small furniture and toymakers? Getty Images Artificial intelligence is expected to change the global economy The 15% cut that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to is likely to hurt their bottom line, even if they earn substantial profits from sales to China. A US official told Reuters that the White House did not believe the sale of H20 and equivalent chips would compromise national security - despite the fact they were previously banned on these grounds. National security experts and some lawmakers have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.

Article: LONDON — Europe is scrambling to stop itself and Ukraine from being frozen out of peace talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, fearing they could reshape the military and political future of the Continent without them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself recounted upward of 15 phone calls with world leaders and others this weekend, from France and Germany to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as news sunk in that there may be no one at the meeting from the country that has been occupied and bombed for more than three years. “We cannot accept” territorial questions being “discussed or even decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told his country’s state broadcaster ARD on Sunday. “I assume that the American government sees it the same way.” Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, Merz and other European leaders issued a joint statement Sunday saying that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Trump announced last week that he would join Putin in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face discussion of his second term, and the first with the Russian president by any G-7 leader since Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022. It is also demanding that Ukraine cede control of the eastern regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, not just the parts of those territories that Moscow currently occupies and that make up around 20% of Ukraine’s total territory.

Democratic leaders in other blue states argued on Sunday morning political shows that they were ready to battle head-to-head over the congressional district maps, which are normally tied to the census taken once a decade. Last week, Newsom hosted Texas Democrats who — under threat of arrest and daily $500 fines — had left the state in a bid to prevent their Legislature from altering the congressional maps. “This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy.” Advertisement Trump has been pushing the Texas GOP to redraw congressional district maps, saying they are “entitled” to five seats.

Ricky Jones, 57, described far right protesters as "disgusting Nazi fascists" at a demonstration in Walthamstow on 7 August last year, according to a video of the event shown to jurors. Opening the case for the prosecution, Ben Holt said Mr Jones had received a flyer warning of a planned protest outside the immigration centre by activist Tommy Robinson, and his supporters. "During this speech Mr Jones referred to the other side, if you like, as disgusting Nazi fascists, and he said that their throats needed to be slit and as he said that he drew his finger along his throat. "This is, the prosecution say, in a setting where violence could readily have been anticipated." Mr Holt said Mr Jones was "rabble rousing" a crowd which has been described as "tens of thousands" in size. 'Razor blades' Mr Holt told the court at the time of the unity rally violent protests had already taken place in the UK, in response to the murder of three children in Southport. He said: "In August last year Mr Jones was a Labour councillor for Dartford and as a result, received, authored and at the very least co-signed documents about the state of flux the country was in at the time." The court was also told Mr Jones had been sent images of stickers on trains which advertised the far right "National Front".

Article: The journalist noted that House Speaker Mike Johnson was in the West Bank, which he referred to as “Judean Samaria,” which the Louisiana Republican said rightly belongs to the Jewish people. Bruce responded that Johnson had simply shared “his opinion.” But when pressed further on whether Johnson’s comments reflected the opinion of the United States government, the State Department’s chief spokesperson replied, “Well, I’m not going to speak about opinion of the government.” The response raised a few eyebrows for reasons that should be obvious: talking to reporters about the country’s foreign policy views are a key part of Bruce’s job, whether she realizes this or not. But while Bruce’s briefings have bordered on satire in recent months, doing lasting harm to reputation and credibility, they appear — predictably — to have been well received in the West Wing. The New York Times reported: President Trump said on Saturday that he was nominating Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department, as the next deputy representative of the United States to the United Nations. Bruce had done a ‘fantastic job’ in her State Department role and that she would ‘represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations.’ Bruce parlayed a lengthy career on Fox News into a Trump administration position, which in turn led to a promotion of sorts. She will still need to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate (which seems like a safe bet); and if successful on Capitol Hill, she’ll likely work alongside Michael Waltz, whom Trump tapped to serve as U.S.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an “absolutely legitimate target” because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014.

Yvette Cooper has said that some supporters of Palestine Action "don't know the full nature" of the group, following the mass arrest of more than 500 people at the weekend. The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and happened after followers caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton. "But it's really important that no-one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." Cooper added there had been "clear security assessments and advice" ahead of the ban. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified." Asked whether there was any reconsideration of the decision to proscribe Palestine Action, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was based on strong security advice. "Palestine action was proscribed based on strong security advice – following serious attacks the group has committed involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage," he said, adding: "Whilst many people may not yet know the reality of the organisation – those assessments are very clear." The spokesman said the police had carried out their duties "without fear or favour", which he said was "a foundational principle of policing by consent".

Article: A United States judge has denied a request by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to unseal transcripts from a grand jury that indicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned former girlfriend and associate of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a decision issued on Monday, Judge Paul A Engelmayer said lawyers for the government failed to convince the court that extraordinary circumstances warranted the release of the grand jury testimony, which is typically delivered privately and sealed. “[The government’s] entire premise – that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the Government’s investigation into them – is demonstrably false,” Engelmayer wrote in his decision. The DOJ in June announced it would not release any additional documents from the investigation into Epstein, causing an uproar among President Donald Trump’s base, which holds a number of conspiracy theories about the well-connected sex trafficker. In 2021, Maxwell was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein – a one-time friend to the powerful and influential in the US – and was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her crimes.

The lawsuit further alleges the staff at the facility was aware of the water leak, but no warning signs were posted, and staff didn't call 911 after the child's fall "despite the obvious severity of her injuries." "An investigation conducted by the state revealed that The Learning Experience was aware of the leaking water into the building–yet no guards were put up and no warning signs were posted. " The lawsuit alleges a staffer at the center told the child's parents in a call that the child was "just bleeding a little" but was given an ice pack and "doing fine." The lawsuit alleges the center was cited during the investigation by the state of Texas childcare licensing division for failing to clean, repair, and maintain the building, grounds, and equipment to protect the health of the children, and for failing to maintain competency and good judgment in the presence of children. "This was not an unavoidable accident but the direct result of The Learning Experience ignoring a known safety hazard and failing to act to protect the children in its care," said attorney Russell Button of The Button Law Firm, who represents the toddler and her parents. "A 2-year-old girl paid the price for that negligence, and we aim to hold The Learning Experience accountable, so this never happens to another child." The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $1,000,000, but the amount will be determined by a jury.

Article: BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A Colombian senator and presidential hopeful whose shooting at a political rally in June recalled some of the darkest chapters of the country’s drug-fueled violence died Monday. READ MORE: Former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe sentenced to 12 years house arrest for bribery The family of Miguel Uribe Turbay said the politician died at a hospital in the capital, Bogota. Uribe, 39, was shot three times, twice in the head, while giving a campaign speech in a park and had since remained in an intensive care unit in serious condition with episodes of slight improvement. “I ask God to show me the way to learn to live without you.” A teenage suspect was arrested at the scene of the June 7 attack in a working-class Bogota neighborhood. The shooting, which was caught on multiple videos, alarmed Colombians who have not seen this kind of political violence against presidential candidates since Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar declared war on the state in the 1990s. “If my mother was willing to give her life for a cause, how could I not do the same in life and in politics?” Uribe, who was just 5 when his mother was killed, said in an interview last year with a Colombian news outlet.

Article: Analysts estimate earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents on revenue of approximately $14.63 billion, reflecting 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth and about 16% year-on-year free cash flow growth to just under $4.1 billion. Bull case: The bullish outlook for Cisco centers on its positioning in high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and software-centric services, which are expected to drive sustained revenue expansion and margin improvement. The company's FY free cash flow estimate of $13.4 billion represents a free cash flow yield of about 4.7%, Bear case: Cisco's traditional networking hardware faces commoditization risks, and while AI orders are promising, the greater than $1 billion in AI orders the company highlighted in May represented between 2%-3% of the company’s total FY-to-date revenues of more than $40 billion. That's not only less than many AI technology companies, but actually well below the rate of earnings growth exhibited by the S & P 500 generally, although these two are closely related, admittedly due to the outsize effects of technology behemoths like Nvidia. One way to play a modestly bullish view in Cisco is by purchasing a longer-dated December 72.5 calls financed in part with the sale of a nearer-dated strangle, such as the September 67.5/80.

While that may be the case in the near term, Jassy previously said that Kuiper "has really good return on invested capital."

The news conference on Monday comes after Trump surged federal law enforcement across the city last week, deploying agents from several federal agencies to work alongside the local Metropolitan Police Department.

Article: Killing lingering cancer cells In the Phase 1 trial, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.) Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors. “Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.” Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. His team is currently running a randomized Phase 2 trial to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence. A growing field Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.” More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences.

Article: Donald Trump has spent the last few days vowing to unveil the details of a new “beautification” initiative regarding Washington, D.C., which the president has said would involve moving homeless people “FAR from the Capital” and reducing crime rates. “Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR.” As for how, exactly, he intends to do this, NBC News reported, “Trump announced this morning that he will federalize the Washington, D.C., police and deploy National Guard troops in an effort to fight crime.” As far as the White House is concerned, this is the first in a series of related steps. We’ll starting very strongly with D.C.” Crime rates in New York City, Baltimore and Oakland have already sharply improved, and while Trump has repeatedly insisted that crime in nation’s capital is “out of control,” in reality, crime in D.C. The president isn’t just deploying National Guard troops in yet another American city, in response to a crisis that doesn’t appear to exist, he’s also claiming emergency powers to federalize a local police department, despite the apparent lack of emergency conditions that might warrant such a move. The president even appears to be creating new criminal statutes on the fly, declaring at his press conference that those who “even think about destroying a statue or monument” in the city will “go to jail for 10 years.” Does he have the legal authority to make such declarations? 6 rioters, many of whom did far more than just spit on police officers during violent clashes at the Capitol, but who nevertheless received presidential pardons from the Republican just hours after his second inaugural.

Article: The Trump Justice Department lost its motion to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Ghislaine Maxwell’s case, with a federal judge on Monday calling the whole premise behind the government’s effort “demonstrably false.” That premise, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York recounted in a scathing opinion, was that the grand jury details would shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes or on the government's investigation into them. Engelmayer, an Obama appointee, noted that the Maxwell grand jury didn’t hear testimony from firsthand witnesses, victims or the like, but rather simply met “for the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.” He said the evidence presented to the Maxwell grand jury “is today, with only very minor exceptions, a matter of public record.” Rather than exposing new information, Engelmayer wrote, unsealing would expose the disingenuousness behind the government’s claim that unsealing would be revelatory. “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency’ but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” the judge wrote. “A member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand jury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to nothing new,” he wrote, adding that the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.” The judge’s ruling is unsurprising, as I previously wrote about the likely limited nature of what unsealing would reveal. It comes amid the administration’s attempt to handle political backlash from President Donald Trump’s supporters over its refusal to release all the information it has related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while being held on sex trafficking charges. After she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month, the government moved Maxwell to a minimum-security facility — an unusual move that has furthered speculation over what sort of additional favorable treatment she might receive. And still pending in New York is the government’s motion to unseal grand jury information in his case there, which the government has been litigating in tandem with the Maxwell unsealing effort. The judge overseeing Epstein’s New York case has not yet ruled, but given the apparently limited nature of the grand jury presentation in that case as well, he could rule in a similar fashion to Engelmayer.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington including deployment of the National Guard, prompting the city’s mayor to voice legal concerns about who would be patrolling the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump said at a Monday news briefing that he was “deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they’re going to be allowed to do their job properly.” The Republican president compared crime in the American capital with that in other major cities, saying Washington performs poorly on safety relative to the capitals of Iraq, Brazil and Colombia, among others. WATCH LIVE: Trump holds news briefing on plans for homelessness and crime in Washington For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials as well as the National Guard, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. Combating crime The president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday. More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. The National Guard Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Crime statistics Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, 28, has been killed along with four of his colleagues in a deliberate Israeli attack on a media tent sheltering journalists outside the main gate of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital. On December 14, 2023, Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa was targeted by an Israeli air strike while reporting alongside Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, who was injured in the same attack. Abudaqa was left to bleed to death at the Farhana school in Khan Younis, where they were filming, as emergency workers were blocked by the Israeli military from reaching the site. On January 7, 2024, Wael’s eldest son and fellow Al Jazeera journalist, Hamza Dahdouh, was killed in a missile strike on the vehicle he was travelling in in Khan Younis. On July 31, 2024, Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi were killed in an Israeli attack on the Shati refugee camp despite their vehicle bearing clear media markings and both wearing vests identifying themselves as members of the news media. Advertisement ​​According to Brown University’s Costs of War project, more journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began on October 7, 2023, than in the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan – combined. Targeting journalists is a war crime Al Jazeera has condemned the targeted killing of its correspondents as “yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom”, noting that al-Sharif and his colleagues were among the last voices reporting from inside Gaza as international media remained barred by Israel. Amnesty International condemned the killings as a war crime and honoured al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter, noting he received the Human Rights Defender Award in 2024 for his commitment to press freedom.

What makes this statistic even more stark is that Gaza is losing voices on the ground at a time when Israel has banned international media from entering the besieged enclave. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said the killings of journalists and their detentions since October 7, 2023, have created a news void that will cause potential war crimes to go undocumented. Advertisement In June, the RSF, CPJ and news organisations published an open letter stating that many Palestinian journalists who have been relied on by reporters outside Gaza have faced a plethora of threats and many “face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness”. In a statement, Amnesty International said: “Israel isn’t just assassinating journalists but attacking journalism itself by preventing the documentation of genocide.” The names of the journalists and media workers killed in Israel’s war on Gaza are listed below:

In a pre-US-Russia summit push aimed at consensus, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz invited Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting on Wednesday. “The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine,” leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain and Finland, and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement ahead of the call. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said “the US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”, but “any deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the whole of Europe’s security.” Advertisement Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday said that the US had pledged to consult with Europe ahead of the summit.

Article: Late Sunday evening, Israel’s military targeted Al Jazeera Arabic’s Gaza correspondents Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and three others, killing them in a drone strike against their media tent at the gate of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “If this madness doesn’t end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people’s voices silenced, their faces erased – and history will remember you as a silent witness to a genocide that you chose not to stop,” he posted. For most of their lives, Israel has imposed a full land, sea and air blockade over the enclave, effectively turning it into what human rights groups describe as an open-air prison. Advertisement The siege affected every aspect of Palestinian life – livelihoods, travel and family connections and compelled al-Sharif and Qreiqeh to dedicate their lives to telling the world about their people’s struggle under Israel’s brutal occupation. Al-Sharif studied media studies at Al-Aqsa University in Gaza and was known for his reporting on the Israeli military campaign that began on October 7, 2023, documenting its humanitarian and civilian impacts. Yaser al-Banna, a Palestinian journalist in Gaza, said that when Israel ordered the entire population of 2.2 million Palestinians to flee south – an act that likely amounts to a war crime – al-Sharif stayed in the north to document the events and actions of the Israeli military. At the time, al-Banna was in southern Gaza and Qreiqeh was in the north, and they often traded contacts and exchanged information to better cover the humanitarian impact of Israel’s genocidal war. “My impression of Qreiqeh was that he was always patient and calm.” Colleagues and friends In October 2024, Israel published unsubstantiated claims that al-Sharif was among six Palestinian journalists affiliated with a Hamas cell, which Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied. Carrying the torch Speaking from Al Jazeera’s studio in Doha, Qatar, their colleague Tamer Almisshal revealed that both al-Sharif and Qreiqeh were mentally and physically exhausted leading up to their deaths.

The AA welcomed the government's plans in the main, but said "the missing element is measures to safeguard and to save new driver and passenger lives by limiting peer-age passengers for six months". They also suggest that male drivers between the ages of 17 and 24 are more likely to be killed or seriously injured than any other age group, apart from those aged 86 or older. Road safety charity Brake said this was due to young drivers being more likely to take risks on the road or crash when they have passengers of their own age, something that does not happen as much for older drivers.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell won’t be released, a judge decided Monday. READ MORE: Ghislaine Maxwell doesn’t want Epstein grand jury transcripts released “And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous,” he added. The judge noted the Justice Department had requested public disclosure of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury, minus redactions to protect privacy, even though the government had identified no information of consequence in the grand jury record that’s not already public. The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.” Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents, in an effort to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who died behind bars while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury’s closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell’s 2021 trial, in victims’ civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses. Epstein already had served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges at the time. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump’s Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn’t exist. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.

Article: World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency start-up founded last year by the Trump family, announced on Monday that a publicly traded technology firm would begin buying large quantifies of its signature digital coin. The firm, a little-known tech company called ALT5 Sigma, is planning to sell $1.5 billion worth of shares, using the proceeds to buy $WLFI, a cryptocurrency created by World Liberty, the announcement said. Similar initiatives have become wildly popular in the crypto world this year, after the success of Strategy, a public tech company formerly known as MicroStrategy that has built a Bitcoin stockpile worth billions of dollars. Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, will join ALT5’s board, and Zach Witkoff, a World Liberty founder and the son of President Trump’s Middle East adviser, will serve as chairman of the board.

Article: TEL AVIV — Outrage is growing over Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned new Gaza Strip offensive, with news of the Israeli leader’s broadening military campaign met with anger at home and condemnation abroad. An association of Israel air force reserve and retired pilots have issued a statement calling for an “immediate end to the futile war and urgent action to bring the hostages home.” “The war being waged in Gaza is exacting an unbearable toll from hostages who have languished in captivity for 676 days, is risking our soldiers’ lives in vain, is causing unnecessary harm to innumerable innocent civilians, and is degrading Israel’s standing in the world to an unprecedented low,” it added on Sunday. The statement — which was the first time the group had explicitly called for an end to the conflict — was issued as Palestinians continued dying from both Israeli fire and hunger. “The decision to send the army deeper into Gaza is a danger to my husband, Omri,” Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, told a news conference Sunday as Netanyahu defended a previously unannounced operation in the besieged and bombarded Palestinian enclave. “We want, first of all, to enable safe zones to be established so the civilian population of Gaza City can move out.” Israel’s goal was not to stay in Gaza — just free it of Hamas, Netanyahu added. “Expanding military operations will only endanger the lives of all civilians in Gaza, including the remaining hostages, and result in further unnecessary suffering,” Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia and Britain said in a joint statement. “This is a manmade crisis, and therefore urgent action is needed to halt starvation and to surge aid into Gaza.” Later Sunday, Al Jazeera said five of its staff members — Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa — were killed “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israeli military said that al-Sharif was “the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.” Al-Sharif and the Qatar-owned broadcaster have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist.

Article: UN condemns targeted Israeli attack that killed five Al Jazeera journalists Palestinians attend the funeral of journalists killed in an Israeli strike Media rights groups and countries including Qatar have condemned the attack. The funerals of Sharif, fellow Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa took place on Monday following the targeted missile strike on their tent in Gaza City. The only materials that have been released for publication are screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. CPJ says at least 186 journalists have been killed since the start of Israel's military offensive in Gaza in October 2023 - the deadliest period for journalists since it began recording such data in 1992. "We call for immediate, safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists." Last month, the BBC and three other news agencies - Reuters, AP and AFP - issued a joint statement expressing "desperate concern" for journalists in the Strip, who they say are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: The announcement on Monday came after an urgent review launched last week after media reports said the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to Israel’s military, including the maintenance of fighter jets, as Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and the Palestinian population rages. The fund, an arm of Norway’s central bank and the world’s largest, held stakes in 61 Israeli companies as of June 30 but in recent days divested stakes in 11 of these, it said in a statement. The Norwegian government began its review after Aftenposten, the country’s leading newspaper, revealed that the fund had a stake in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL), which provides parts to Israeli fighter jets that are being deployed in the war on Gaza. Several of Europe’s biggest financial firms have cut back their links to Israeli companies or those with ties to the country, according to an analysis of filings by the Reuters news agency, as pressure mounts from activists and governments to end the war in Gaza. Last month, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, called on countries to cut off all trade and financial ties with Israel, including a full arms embargo, and withdraw international support for what she termed an “economy of genocide”. In a report titled From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide, Albanese detailed “the corporate machinery sustaining Israel’s settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory”. The report singled out companies – including arms manufacturers, technology giants, heavy machinery companies and financial institutions – for their “complicity” in Israel’s repression of Palestinians from sustaining Israeli expansions onto occupied land to enabling the surveillance and killings of Palestinians.

Article: (This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Josh — I'll start with a chart that caught my eye showing two of the seven semiconductor companies on our Best Stocks in the Market list essentially being one big trade. There's very little daylight between how these stocks act day to day, week to week: President Donald Trump made it clear last week that the manufacturing of semiconductors on U.S. KLA Corp , a company formerly known as KLA Tencorp, has been shocking Wall Street with explosive earnings reports lately, including a 60% increase in EPS with a 30% jump in revenue in the latest quarter. Lam Research is a $130 billion company that specializes in areas of the chip manufacturing process like etch tools that precisely remove material layers from a wafer as well as wet and plasma-based cleaning equipment to remove contaminants. Both companies derive less than 10% of their revenue from North America, which means that Trump's new tariffs represent both a challenge and a substantial opportunity as the domestic demand picture shifts into overdrive. Top sector ranking: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sean — We have seven semiconductor companies on our list (inclusive of semi equipment firms too), which ranks fourth out of our industry exposure: That list includes: ADI , ALAB , AMD , AVGO , KLAC , LRCX and NVDA . Tariffs on imported chips and related technologies are viewed as a tool to protect and incentivize the U.S.-based production, ensuring a stable supply, safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI race. Equipment makers such as KLAC and LRCX benefit as domestic fabs expand capacity, while chip designers like AMD and NVDA gain from increased availability of homegrown manufacturing partners and potentially reduced reliance on overseas foundries.

Article: Milwaukee area drying out after weekend rain causes record flooding on multiple rivers No fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning from the storms that began Saturday night and stretched into Sunday. MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial state records of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. Tom Groppi told WISN-TV that the basement of his Milwaukee home never flooded in more than 50 years, but he had 3 feet (about 91 centimeters) of water in it this weekend. "We are not expecting the level that we saw over the weekend, but there could be some areas that get some heavy downpours," said Sarah Marquardt, a National Weather Service meteorologist at the Milwaukee/Sullivan office. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away in quickly moving water on a road flooded by the Root River in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee. The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon's Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee.

Article: Perseid meteor shower: When, where and how to catch a glimpse 39 minutes ago Share Save Maddie Molloy Climate and science reporter Share Save Getty Images Stargazers will soon be treated to what could be one of the year's most dazzling displays, with the Perseid meteor shower reaching its peak on Monday and Tuesday nights. "This year's peak unfortunately lines up with a full Moon meaning even in dark sky areas it will be impossible to see the full 100 meteors per hour," said Mr Burridge. "However, [the Sturgeon Moon] is no reason not to go out and enjoy the shower - it is still likely that you will see at least 1 or 2 fireballs per hour, even with a full moon," he added. "After the full Moon is more likely the better time to view, since the Moon will rise later in the night, so I would recommend the peak nights as well as weekend of 16 and 17 August," he added. Most parts of the UK will sit under fairly cloudy skies though the first half of Monday night, although there will be glimpses of clearer skies too, especially for parts of Northern Ireland, north-west England and southern Scotland. After sunset, areas of cloud and scattered showers are likely to develop across parts of Northern Ireland and the far north-west of England for a time, before drifting into central and southern Scotland.

Article: If you’re using AOL dial-up internet to read this story, you might want to put down your can of Surge and turn off your episode of “ER.” We have some bad news. CDs offering free trial internet service were ubiquitous in mailboxes, and the service’s “You’ve got mail” chime and chatrooms were so famous they inspired a 1998 film about online romance starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But children of the ’90s sat through excruciatingly long waits — and a series of electronic whistles, beeps and static as their modems connected — to download photos of rock singer Courtney Love playing her Fender Squier Venus guitar or Bush front man Gavin Rossdale shirtless. In maybe the most mid-’90s story, The Post wrote in May 1994 about AOL users on the Alternative Rock forum sharing bereavements and poems about the death of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, Love’s husband. (Now, with broadband internet service, computers simply remain connected to the ISP and work at 400 times the speed of dial-up.) For many users, a lasting memory of starting an AOL session are the unforgettable, jolting beeps as the modem connected. Dial-up cratered and the junk mail CDs that AOL sent out to entice people with free hours of internet access became little more than Frisbees for children to fling at each other. In 2015, about 2.1 million people were still using AOL’s dial-up, according to CNBC, adding a quote from an unnamed source that it was “in the low thousands” in May 2021.

In one scene, an A.I.-generated Muppet Trump reclines on Epstein’s private jet, receiving a foot massage and being fed McDonald’s French fries by scantily clad young Muppet women — an image I won’t forget anytime soon unless I’m very, very lucky. The style of both videos — their goofy, very-online mix of accusations and insinuations, their readiness to just say stuff — reminded me of nothing so much as Donald Trump himself. Across that decade, the usual strategy for Trump’s critics, Republicans and Democrats alike, has been to adopt a contrasting seriousness: They have tried to present as the high-minded adults in the room, the ones who aren’t constantly slinging insults, posting nasty cartoon memes and stoking fringe theories.

Nearly 200,000 customers remain under a boil water order issued by the Passaic Valley Water Commission after the break occurred Friday on a 30-inch water main in Paterson — the state's third-largest city. The advisory — which asks residents not to fill large jugs or containers, water lawns and not open hydrants until at least Friday — mainly is for Paterson but also includes three other smaller, neighboring communities. “Once we do bring pressures back up, we still have to do sampling and some (system) flushing, so it could take another day after pressures are back before the order is lifted,” Passaic Valley Water Commission Executive Director Jim Mueller said.

The tremor was felt as far away as Istanbul, nearly 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the north, raising fears in the city of over 16 million people, which experts say is at high risk for a major earthquake. The apartment building in Sindirgi was among the few inhabited structures to fall, prompting authorities to detain the owner and the constructor for questioning on suspicion of “causing death and injury by negligence,” Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said.

Article: That's because this week's inflation data is the last before Federal Reserve policymakers convene next week for their annual summer consortium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, an event that will likely shape expectations for their September meeting. "We are Tactically Bullish as we see this week's macro data (Retail Sales, CPI, PPI, Jobless Claims) remaining supportive of [the] bull case, with earnings likely to maintain their positive trend," read a note from the trading desk at JPMorgan. "If the inflation increases are more gradual, then the market is likely to remain unbothered unless/until we get to a level that would make a rate hike a credible threat." To be sure, the team added, the key risk is that CPI will come out stronger. Nevertheless, the JPMorgan trading desk expects that a more threatening level in core, year-over-year inflation would mean a rate of 4.0%, rather than the 3.0% some economists are expecting from the next core CPI report. In this case, easier inflation might drive the S & P 500 to a gain of 0.75% to 1.2% Just a 5% chance that core month-over-month CPI drops to less than 0.25%.

Article: Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts. "You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump. If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, "This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy." "This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote. "If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote. The governor added that if the other states "call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same." Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps. That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

It was posted on his social media account several hours after an Israeli strike killed him and journalists Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa at a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Last month, when Anas broke down on camera while reporting on the starvation, people told him: “Keep going, Anas, don’t stop, you are our voice.” And indeed, he was our voice. Anas is now gone, and I feel I was wrong to hope, wrong to believe in the justice of this world, watching him appeal – with eyes overflowing with tears – to a global conscience that proved to be low and selective. I wished the war had ended before you were martyred so I could go find you in Gaza and tell you that our voices had succeeded, they had reached to the outside world and driven change. For me, that means speaking, writing, and exposing the crimes of this bloody and brutal occupation … until the day you dreamed of, Anas – the day this genocide, the most horrific in modern history, ends.

Article: Although the motive of the suspected shooter — Patrick White, 30, from Kennesaw — remains unknown, he told a neighbor that he believed the Covid vaccines had made him sick, a source told NBC News on the condition of anonymity. For some employees, the shooting highlighted growing hostility toward public health officials, which they feel has been shaped by Kennedy’s long history of spreading vaccine misinformation, including the Covid vaccine. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Just last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines — the same technology used to develop Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed “mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy ”has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,” Nixon said, “not a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.” Kennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting. “There’s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that’s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,” CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. “People feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,” said one CDC employees who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions. An employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it’s not lost on them that Kennedy “has demonized our work.” In an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was “deeply unsettling,” especially for those working in Atlanta.

Article: The battle over potential mid-decade redistricting in Texas -- where the state's congressional district lines could be redrawn well ahead of the upcoming census -- continued Monday as dozens of Texas House Democrats remained out of state for a second week to block any potential votes on the map. In Austin, the Texas House of Representatives is scheduled to meet and the redistricting bill is technically scheduled for a second reading (which would not be a vote to pass it out of the chamber). The Texas Senate is also scheduled to meet and may vote on its own version of redistricting legislation, although if it votes the bill out of the Senate it cannot be voted on in the House until there is a quorum. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Abbott has also said he will call special legislative session after special session to get the Republican-supported maps passed, even if Democrats run out the 30-day clock on the current session. "If they want to evade that arrest, they're going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years, and they might as well just start voting in California or voting in Illinois, wherever they may be," he continued. speaks during a press conference held by Texas Democratic lawmakers after leaving the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw Texas' 38 congressional districts, in Aurora, Ill., Aug.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Just before HISD opens its doors to a new school year, the athletic department honored some of HISD's best and brightest athletes and coaches at the 2025 Hall of Honor ceremony at Delmar Fieldhouse. "It is a way we can honor former athletes and coaches, and it can also let current and future students know that these individuals walked the same halls as they walk at the same schools," HISD Athletic Director Andre Walker Sr. "I feel blessed and happy to be here."

Article: government will take 15% of the revenue that chipmaker Nvidia pulls in from sales in China of its H20 microchip, which is used in the development of artificial intelligence, President Trump said on Monday. At a news conference at the White House, Trump said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked for restrictions on exports to be eased so that Nvidia could sell H20s into the Chinese market. Trump called the H20 "obsolete," and "an old chip that China already has … in a different form, different name." Nvidia designed the H20 to be less powerful than the company's top-of-the-line microchips to comply with export controls. Trump suggested that Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which he called "super duper advanced," might also be in play, but in a diminished form — and that he'd want a 30-to-50% cut of those sales.

Article: California is asking Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. On Monday, Trump said he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city’s police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as the mayor has noted that crime is falling in the nation’s capital. WATCH: Trump says he’s placing Washington police under federal control and deploying National Guard In June, the Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. The Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. After their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. The Trump administration argued the troops were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel in Los Angeles, which has been a key location in the federal government’s aggressive immigration strategy. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him. The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that AMD, the second-place AI chip maker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

"And nothing that the Israeli forces has produced so far in terms of evidence gives us any kind of assurance that he was even an active member of Hamas." The 'only voice' left in Gaza City AFP via Getty Images Anas al-Sharif was one of the few voices left reporting in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera Anas al-Sharif became one of Al Jazeera's most prominent reporters in Gaza during the war. "He worked for the whole length of the war inside Gaza reporting daily on the situation of people and the attacks which are committed in Gaza," Salah Negm, director of news at Al Jazeera English, told the BBC. Married with a four-year-old daughter, Sham, and a one-year-old son, Salah, he was separated from them for long stretches during the war while he continued to report from the north of the territory after refusing to follow Israeli evacuation orders. He reported on the targeting of his colleagues, including prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in 2024 in an air strike in Gaza City. Raed Fakih, input manager at Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel, told the BBC Sharif was "courageous, dedicated, and honest - that's what made him successful as a journalist with hundreds of thousands of social media followers from all over the world". And even in the face of death, he persisted, because this is a story that must be told." Mohammed Qreieh, 33, was a father of two from Gaza City, the Associated Press news agency reported. Israel alleges Sharif led 'terrorist cell', with little evidence The Israeli military accused Sharif of posing as a journalist, saying he had "served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas" and was responsible for launching rocket attacks at Israelis - but it has produced little evidence to support these claims. In a statement, the IDF said it had documents which "unequivocally prove" his "military affiliation" with Hamas, including "personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents". It has publicly released some screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. He described this as a "longstanding pattern" and referred to the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that’s more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu’s office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

Article: ET Campbell RobertsonKatie Rogers and President Trump significantly escalated his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital on Monday, saying that he was temporarily taking control of the city’s police department and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime there. At a White House news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington — including “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth” — that stood in sharp contrast to official figures showing violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days. Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of D.C., called them “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,” and said his office “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.” Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize. Familiar targets: In decrying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Article: The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will need to drastically cut rations to refugees in Kenya due to reductions in global aid, including major funding cuts from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Residents of the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps were beginning to feel the impact of food aid cuts on Monday as the WFP implemented a new assistance system there in which certain groups are prioritised over others. The WFP said aid is being cut by 60 percent for the most vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and disabled people, and by 80 percent for refugees with some kind of income. This will have a serious impact on vulnerable refugees, increasing the risk of hunger and malnutrition.” “There has been a lot of tension in the last couple of weeks or so,” Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi said, reporting from Kakuma. “People were very angry about what WFP is calling the priority food distribution, where some people will not get food at all and others are going to get a small fraction of the food.” These tensions boiled over, triggering protests last week, which left one person dead and several others injured, said Soi, adding that WFP officials she spoke with said the aid cuts from organisations like USAID meant they have had to make “very difficult decisions about who gets to eat and who doesn’t”. “We need to look at them separately and differently and see how best we can channel the system so that it provides.” The impact of these cuts is severe amid concerns over malnutrition. “Already the food that is being issued is quite low, 40 percent of the recommended ration, and this is being shared by a bigger chunk of the population,” Chica said, adding that stocks will therefore not last as long as hoped.

Article: US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the "obsolete" H20 chip to China. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it "a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security." Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue." Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia's chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Kennedy Jr., a leading anti-science voice and longtime opponent of vaccines, “shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.” Similarly, MSNBC reported that the violence has left officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency understandably shaken, and “many are now demanding answers” from Kennedy, who “has long vilified the CDC and contributed to a culture of misinformation that they say makes them targets.” (The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment.) Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University, summarized the deadly violence this way in an opinion piece for The New York Times: “The attack left both himself and a law enforcement officer dead, and C.D.C. union has asked federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, since it is putting lives at risk.” It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump, as of this writing, has not commented on the CDC shooting at all, despite the president maintaining an active publishing schedule on his social media platform in recent days. Jerome Adams told CBS’ Margaret Brennan on ‘Face the Nation.’ During his on-air appearance, Adams, who served with Trump during the president’s first term, characterized Kennedy’s response to the deadly shooting as “tepid,” and emphasized how long it took for RFK Jr. “It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings, and that’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams added. Instead, the beleaguered HHS secretary posted condolences “more than 30 minutes after posting photos of himself fishing on social media.” Time will tell whether the deadly shooting causes RFK Jr.

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so. His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a “humanitarian catastrophe.” Australia’s government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. Albanese says conditions must be met for Palestine recognition Albanese told reporters after a Cabinet meeting Monday that Australia’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. READ MORE: France will recognize Palestine as a state, President Macron says “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said. “The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.” Netanyahu rebuked Australia before the announcement Ahead of Albanese’s announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state. The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. “This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all,” Albanese said. A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state. In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government “will carefully weigh up its position” on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September. “This commitment removes any incentive or diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always stood in the way of ending the conflict,” spokesperson for the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said in a statement. He told reporters in Melbourne on Monday that the move would do nothing to end the “ongoing genocide in Gaza which has been live streamed for the entire world for two years.”

Article: BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — An Islamic court in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province on Monday sentenced two men to public caning, 80 times each, after Islamic religious police caught them engaged in what the court deemed were sexual acts: hugging and kissing. The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” READ MORE: South Korean investigators seek arrest of ex-President Yoon’s wife The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

Article: Congressman Abraham Hamadeh made a brief visit to Syria where he discussed with the country’s interim president the return of the body of an American aid worker who was taken hostage and later confirmed dead in the war-torn country, his office said Monday. Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority. The militant group lost most of its territory in Iraq in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019 when it lost the last sliver of land it controlled in east Syria. Mueller, from Prescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, where he had been hired to fix the internet service for the hospital.

The warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) comes after the watchdog announced it would set up a compensation scheme for motorists who were sold car finance deals that were unlawful. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the FCA announced it would start consulting on setting up a compensation scheme for eligible motorists, and it expects most eligible people to get less than £950. "We're aware of scammers calling people and posing as car finance lenders, offering fake compensation and asking for personal details," said Nisha Arora, director of special projects at the FCA. If anyone receives a call like this, hang up immediately and do not share any information." The FCA said it would never ask people for bank account PINs or passwords, and it has urged people to report any scam calls or texts to Ofcom. In a joint statement with the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the FCA pointed out that motorists could sacrifice up to 30% of any claims award in fees to the CMC or law firm. The point of a centralised redress scheme would be to make it easy for consumers to get compensation, without the need for help from a CMC or law firm, the FCA said. The final bill for the redress scheme could be as much as £18bn, with the watchdog estimating millions of people who bought new or used cars potentially dating back as far as 2007 could be eligible to make claims.

Article: A group of Democratic lawmakers is pressing Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink for details on the Trump administration’s plan to pull funds from an Air Force nuclear modernization program to retrofit a luxury jet the president was given by the Qatari government. Jamie Raskin (Maryland) and John Garamendi (California) want answers on the plan to pay for this presidential vanity project with up to $934 million from the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program, which is meant to upgrade the military’s nuclear arsenal. But rather than slash the program (like, say, funding for cutting-edge mRNA research and other things the administration has deemed wasteful), the administration plans to pull $400 million from it to retrofit Trump’s palatial new airplane, Meink said last month at a Senate subcommittee hearing. As one might imagine, the aforementioned Democrats are raising issues in a letter addressed to Meink last Wednesday: We write with concerns about how the Air Force is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to President Trump that likely violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Deb Fischer of Nebraska have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the executive branch’s pet projects, the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting president, who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description: Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the Sentinel program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the Qatari luxury jet to serve as Air Force One — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the Trump library’s private plane. They go on: It appears that funds for programs that the Air Force has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for presidential whims, while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers. On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund joined the pressure campaign, urging the Defense Department’s inspector general to open a probe into whether the administration has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically given to the Department of Defense).

And clearly, in the years since, he has become the preeminent figure in the Republican Party and taken the Republican Party in many ways in very different directions from those espoused by President Reagan. INSKEEP: In the current president's constant changes of attitude and position toward other world leaders, toward various wars and other situations, do you see any possibility of something like you described with Reagan where he confronted the Soviet Union and then got to another phase, and things got better? And so remember during his first term where he went from threatening to rain fire and fury on North Korea to talking about how much he loved Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. But right now, it's very hard to figure out what his method is actually gaining us because, you know, all that zigzagging is, I think, very confusing not just to Americans, but also to other world leaders.

Article: The president’s move also spurred Democratic governors, including Newsom, to pledge retaliatory redistricting efforts in their states — setting up the possibility of an extended standoff that could upend the 2026 midterm elections. Lawler calls for redistricting battles to end Newsom urged Trump in a letter Monday to abandon his scheme, telling the president he is “playing with fire” and “risking the destabilization of our democracy.” Newsom said he prefers that independent bodies draw political districts rather than partisan legislatures, as is done in Texas and most GOP-controlled states. But, he wrote, “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” If Texas and “the other states call off their redistricting efforts,” the governor added, “we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.” Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying in Illinois, New York and elsewhere, and they say they have no intentions of returning as long as Republicans are intent on mollifying Trump. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,” Abbott said over the weekend on “Fox News Sunday.” At the least, Texas lawmakers face $500 daily fines for each absence under legislative rules. She compared both the proposed Texas maps, which would disproportionately affect districts represented by Black and Latino Democrats, and Abbott’s and Paxton’s threats to the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. “Their fight is our fight, and just like the Civil Rights heroes of the past, no matter the cost we are prepared to see it through to the end,” Bowers said.

Article: The U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is happening at a site where East meets West — quite literally — in a place familiar to both countries as a Cold War front line of missile defense, radar outposts and intelligence gathering. But the Kremlin has long pushed back against Putin meeting Zelenskyy -– at least until a peace deal is reached by Russia and Ukraine and was ready to be signed. Putin said last week he wasn’t against meeting Zelenskyy “but certain conditions need to be created” for it to happen and were “still a long way off.” That raised fears about excluding Ukraine from negotiations. READ MORE: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in Russia as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit After the USSR’s collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don’t play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.” Sam Greene of King’s College London said on X the symbolism of Alaska as the site of a summit about Ukraine was “horrendous — as though designed to demonstrate that borders can change, land can be bought and sold.” What’s the agenda? Moscow presented ceasefire conditions that are nonstarters for Zelenskyy, such as withdrawing troops from the four regions Russia illegally annexed in 2022, halting mobilization efforts, or freezing Western arms deliveries. For a broader peace, Putin demands Kyiv cede the annexed regions, even though Russia doesn’t fully control them, and Crimea, renounce a bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language along with Ukrainian. Putin has warned Ukraine it will face tougher conditions for peace as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for territory still under Ukrainian control in the four annexed regions annexed by Moscow. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to cement Russia’s territorial gains, keep Ukraine out of NATO and prevent it from hosting any Western troops so Moscow can gradually pull the country back into its orbit. He believes time is on his side as Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances along the front line amid swarms of Moscow’s missiles and drones battering the country. “A sustainable peace also means that aggression cannot be rewarded.” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday he believed Trump was “making sure that Putin is serious, and if he is not, then it will stop there.” “If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue. Since last week, Putin spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as well as the leaders of South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, the Kremlin said.

Testifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agents.

Article: What to know about DC Home Rule Act as Trump puts DC police under federal control President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Section 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president the ability to use D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department for "federal purposes" that the president "may deem necessary and appropriate." On Monday, Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of D.C.'s police force. On Capitol Hill, many Democrats have said the moves are a power grab by the president and a distraction from other matters, such as Trump's involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein files. Chris Murphy said in a post on X that "Trump's decision to take over the DC police isn't about public safety" and is "another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent." In a post on X, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith wrote, "WHAT THE HECK IS IN THOSE FILES?!" -- a reference to the Epstein files -- accompanied by a video of Trump in the briefing room for his announcement.

Article: “In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.” The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday. The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said. Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Link: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-plans-to-widen-coming-offensive-beyond-gaza-city-into-last-areas-not-under-its-control
Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel plans to widen its coming offensive beyond Gaza City to the last areas not yet under Israeli control, and where most of Gaza’s 2 million residents have sought shelter as the territory slides toward famine. The mobilization of forces is expected to take weeks, and Israel may be using the threat of a wider offensive to try to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages or surrendering after 22 months of war sparked by its Oct. Any expansion of Israeli operations is likely to bring even more death and destruction to the war-ravaged territory, around 75% of which is already largely destroyed and controlled by Israel. Netanyahu says Israel will go into the central camps Israel announced last week its plans to take over Gaza City, where it has already carried out major raids and heavy bombardment throughout the war. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss aspects of the plans that have not been made public, said the operation will not begin immediately and will take a significant amount of time to scale up. Few places left to flee Netanyahu said Israel will allow civilians to flee to “designated safe zones,” where “they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.” He did not say where they would go. Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly floated the idea of transferring Gaza’s population to a so-called “humanitarian city” that the military would build on the ruins of the southernmost city of Rafah — now a largely uninhabited Israeli military zone — on the border with Egypt. READ MORE: Israel targets and kills Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif in Gaza airstrike as journalist toll grows A possible negotiating tactic Netanyahu has said he will end the war if Hamas gives up power, lays down its arms and releases the remaining 50 hostages — around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group says it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not give up its weapons as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. But the hostages are Hamas’ only remaining bargaining chip, and it is unlikely to give them up if it believes that Israel will then resume the war, attempt to eradicate the group and carry out plans to depopulate Gaza.

Article: Compared to recent weeks, earnings won't be as much of a catalyst for the markets with only a small handful of stocks in the S & P 500 scheduled to report. Nvidia deal : The market doesn't mind that Club name Nvidia and peer AMD will have to give the United States a 15% share of all AI chip sales to China. The arrangement, confirmed by President Donald Trump on Monday, is part of a broader deal announced last month that restored the companies' ability to sell AI chips to Chinese customers. That ability had been revoked in April, when the Trump administration tightened Biden-era export controls that had forced Nvidia and AMD to design throttled-back versions of their top-end AI chips for the Chinese market. The bigger prize is maintaining the ability to sell to China, a market that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated could be worth $50 billion in the next few years. "From Nvidia's standpoint and from AMD's standpoint, I get it, like 85 cents is better than anything, and it's important for them to be able to sell into China because otherwise you're just handing that market over to China and to the local players. We need to be able to compete there, so that's good," Rasgon said on "The Exchange." He added, "I think that should happen on their own merits." To size up the potential impact of this payment, Nvidia was selling about $8 billion worth of chips to China a quarter prior to the previous export restriction. That's a large number for most companies, but not for Nvidia: analysts estimate the company will do about $200 billion in revenue over its ongoing fiscal year 2026 and $255 billion in fiscal year 2027.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multi-year war between Ukraine and Russia. Trump said he’s going to see what Putin “has in mind” to end the war and, if it’s a “fair deal,” he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting. Asked on Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to Alaska, Trump said the Ukrainian leader “wasn’t a part of it” and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as “really a feel-out,” would be to Zelenskyy “out of respect.” He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy "‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say, ‘we can make a deal.’" The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city’s police force. During his remarks, the president noted how even following “a great call” with Putin in the past, “missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you’d have 60 people laying on a road dying,” a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal. “Now, I will say this, ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” the president added. He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the “best deal that could be made for both parties.” But “there’ll be some swapping, there’ll be some changes in land,” Trump said, returning to the idea of so-called “land swaps,” which he said on Friday would be “to the betterment of both.” Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. “Next Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.

Article: Even as the 47th president, he still regularly launches late-night, ALL-CAPS social media rants about other countries “LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.” But it’s his fear and loathing of China “laughing” at the United States that he’s made into a firm pillar of his political movement. They will regularly fulminate about China dominating the world and accuse every American leader other than Trump of surrendering our country’s greatness to the “globalists” and “communists.” And yet, less than seven months into Trump’s second term, China is sitting pretty when it comes to its economic, military and diplomatic clout around the world. A country with a huge market that was acting as a bulwark against Chinese economic domination of Asia seems like the kind of ally a president obsessed with China’s ascendance would want. Following Trump’s gutting of Voice of America, China expanded its media operations in Asia and Africa, where the citizenry can get a healthy dose of subtle pro-China propaganda with no pro-America counterpart. In a report released in July, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote, “In private, our allies tell us that Chinese officials are gleeful, characterizing the United States as unreliable. But in many cases, Beijing is doubling down on its own long-term investments — in overseas infrastructure, critical minerals exploitation and exchange programs that bring foreign talent to Chinese universities — all while America withdraws.” It also appears that many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot who is advancing China’s interests at the expense of America’s. Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton wrote in The Hill that some examples of “Trump’s softness” on China “include allowing Nvidia to resume exports of sensitive information technology to China and ignoring legal requirements to ban TikTok or force it to divest its Chinese ownership.” Many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot. Trump has also taken pains to not displease Chinese leader Xi Jinping over Taiwan — which the CCP views as an illegitimate breakaway state that it intends to bring under its yoke someday. The Trump administration last month told Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te to avoid a stopover in New York, according to reporting in The New York Times, which also quoted former Trump administration deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger as saying the U.S. “bent over backwards” to avoid offending China and that “Beijing will pocket this concession and ask for more.” Nicholas Grossman wrote in these pages in April, “If the eventual result is China’s rising to become the world’s predominant power, historians will note that it didn’t take global leadership, America threw it away.” But we don’t have to wait for historians’ take on Trump inexplicably ceding many of America’s long-held advantages on the global stage to China.

Article: Five more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing blockade of Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, the Health Ministry has said, as people in the enclave and many beyond its besieged borders mourned several journalists assassinated by Israel. The ministry on Monday said most of these victims died in the past three weeks, as Israel-imposed starvation engulfs the entire population, with the total number of severe hunger deaths now at 222, including 101 children. It’s time for statements to turn into action and for an immediate ceasefire.” At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raids across Gaza since dawn on Monday, including six aid seekers, medical sources have told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, on a daily basis, Israeli forces and US contractors are continuing to kill Palestinians desperately seeking aid at distribution points run by the controversial United States and Israeli-backed GHF. An outpouring of grief and condemnation followed the Israeli assassination of five Al Jazeera Arabic staff in Gaza, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, in a drone attack late on Sunday that hit a tent for journalists positioned outside the main gate of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital. The attack came days after the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, warned of “unfounded accusations by the Israeli army” against al-Sharif after Israel repeatedly and falsely accused the 28-year-old reporter of being a Hamas affiliate. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors: first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming seizure of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Advertisement Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum, who reports for the network’s English channel, said the journalists were “working around the clock to unearth facts on the ground and keep the world informed about what has been going on in Gaza”.

Article: An explosion at a steel plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States has left one dead and dozens injured or trapped, with emergency workers on site trying to rescue victims, officials said. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it’s like something bad happened.” Dozens were injured and the county was sending 15 ambulances, in addition to the ambulances supplied by local emergency response agencies, Reigner said. Air quality concerns and health warnings The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major US Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers. The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosion and advised residents within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. In another lawsuit, residents said that following a massive 2018 fire, the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs, and was hard to breathe due to the release of sulfur dioxide. Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5m in equipment upgrades and $5m on local clean air efforts and programmes as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by the Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has previously sued US Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” In June, US Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalised a “historic partnership”, a deal that gives the US government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15bn buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after US Steel shareholders approved it.

This is why he formally declared a public safety emergency in the city in a pair of executive orders that placed the Metropolitan Police Department under the federal government control and directed 800 National Guard members into the streets. Trump went even further, seemingly soft-launching the case for potential federal intervention in more Democrat-led cities — Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland — “if they don’t learn their lesson” to address crime. In June, he sent nearly 5,000 troops to Los Angeles — mostly National Guard but also, much more unusually, several hundred Marines — after protests broke out over his immigration policies, blurring the line between the U.S.

Article: Doubt over the accuracy and integrity of the data is a serious issue considering how much BLS work is used to formulate policy, calculate Social Security payments and inform any number of other political and economic decisions. "I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time," DoubleLine CEO Jeffery Gundlach said last week on CNBC. data has never been perfect, but has been of high quality, compiled impartially, and useful in the setting of policy." Questions on multiple fronts Gapen's sentiments mirror those around Wall Street, where written commentary has broken down the various issues the BLS has already faced in terms of budget cuts that have pushed it to alter the way it is collecting some data. Also, notable revisions the BLS has applied to its critical monthly payrolls count have raised concerns, including accusations from Trump that the McEntarfer-led BLS was manipulating the data for political purposes. "We argue the data remain reliable, though we would recommend being careful with the initial jobs data." Looking for inflation clues On the market's plate this week, though, are the two key inflation readings, first with the consumer price index on Tuesday, then the producer price measure, considered a gauge of costs at the wholesale level, on Thursday. At issue for the BLS is its move to stop collecting CPI data from several cities due to staffing limitations, as well as the growing use of imputed data, or estimating price movements in areas where it can't get exact information. In those cases, the BLS will try to use data from another source, preferably somewhere near to the locale it is surveying, but sometimes it has to use prices from other urban areas as assumptions. Bank of America estimates that a combination of different-cell imputation and the varied impact of tariffs likely will alter the headline CPI reading by only a basis point or two — 0.01 or 0.02 percentage point. "Still we do not think the BLS' decision to reduce the CPI sample is enough to warrant alarm over the signal from the inflation data." Impact on Fed moves Indeed, precision will matter as the Federal Reserve closely monitors inflation data and charts its monetary policy course. Excluding food and energy, the respective forecasts for core inflation are 0.3% for the month and 3.1% for the year, the latter up 0.2 percentage point from a month ago. "Sequential firming in inflation is one key factor behind our view that the Fed will remain on hold at the September meeting despite recent employment data that point to a sharp slowdown in labor demand," Morgan Stanley's Gapen wrote. Traders widely expect the central bank to cut the fed funds in September, then at least once more before the end of the year, but Wall Street economists are in multiple camps. "Taken at face value, the new procedures implemented by the BLS should not introduce systematic bias into its estimates of CPI inflation, but it will increase volatility in future CPI prints," Gapen wrote.

Cooprider said he “would like to get rid of it,” the texts show, saying the two were “not in love” or together and that it would be “messed up to bring a child into the world without both parents raising them.” When Cooprider reiterated his desire for Davis to “get rid of it” after her pregnancy test came back positive days later, she asked him to use a different phrase. “I literally feel like I’m going down the steepest hill on a roller coaster when I read that.” The following text messages allegedly show Cooprider telling Davis, without her approval, that he would order abortion pills online.

Article: The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.” Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Article: Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown 44 minutes ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Share Save Watch: Trump announces deployment of National Guard to Washington DC President Donald Trump said he was deploying the National Guard to Washington DC and taking control of the city's police force as he pledged to crack down on crime and homelessness in the city. "I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse," Trump said during a news conference in which he was flanked by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will lead the city's police force while it is under federal control. Mayor Bowser, a Democrat, acknowledged there had been a "terrible" spike in crime in 2023, which mirrored a national trend, but she pushed back against any claims of a crimewave in the city. "The president is very aware of our efforts." When asked about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's comment that Washington is more violent than Baghdad, Bowser said "any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false". That act was instituted by former President Richard Nixon to allow residents of Washington DC - which is the only US city that is not in any of the 50 states - to elect a city council and a mayor. On Sunday, when asked about the possibility of the president taking control of the city's police department, Mayor Bowser said: "There are very specific things in our law that would allow [that]. "We have seen a huge decrease in crime because of those efforts." Watch: DC Mayor Bowser says crime in the city is at a 30-year low As well as crime, Trump also spoke at length about homelessness in Washington DC. "If our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty and they don't respect us." Local groups working with homeless people in the capital told the BBC they had actually seen progress in recent years. Homelessness is down almost 20% for individuals in Washington DC in 2025 compared to five years ago, said Ralph Boyd, the president and chief executive of So Others Might Eat (SOME) - a group that provides people in the city with housing, clothing and other social services.

Article: As this shift to cloud computing took hold, Melius noted that these companies all saw a steep contraction in their price-to-earnings multiples, a classic sign that investors believe slower growth is ahead. The cloud was a priority for CEO Satya Nadella upon taking over in early 2014, and it's paid off handsomely for investors — just take a look at the stock chart versus the S & P 500. Microsoft would have no doubt been on that list of on-premise fallen angels — even if not a hardware play like Hewlett-Packard and Dell — had they not jumped on cloud computing and instead kept their fate tied to the on-premise hardware providers. Instead of companies paying for a perpetual license to use a specific version of software, SaaS companies sold their product on a subscription basis, bringing in a more predictable recurring revenue stream that investors were willing to assign a higher multiple. They added, "We think there will be FOMO across all industries to cut costs and get their stocks up - SaaS is the casualty as AI adoption accelerates." To be sure, while this is a potential concern for Salesforce, plenty of other tech names in the portfolio stand to benefit. Indeed, the Melius analysts themselves contend: "While SaaS should be avoided, 'Software' companies with clouds [such as Microsoft and Oracle] are continuing to see acceleration in demand." "Another area fueling demand is the acceleration of AI agents that do the work of SaaS and fuel demand for more compute," Melius added. Agentic AI is a type of AI system that can complete certain tasks without human intervention, and it's become a big area of investment and focus in the AI race — including for Salesforce. And given that SaaS is generally based on the seat-based licensing model, if Salesforce's customers have fewer employees because their remaining ones are using AI to be more productive, that translates to less demand for software seats — all else being equal. Instead, the company is working to build out its agentic AI offering, appropriately dubbed Agentforce, so that it can help clients move more quickly into the AI era, while also building out a new AI-oriented revenue stream that can hopefully help extract more revenue from those seats at customers that do remain. Unlike Adobe, it's also important to keep in mind that Salesforce is targeted almost exclusively toward enterprise, where the customer cohort tends to be more sticky and a bit slower to change things up, lest they risk a misstep that hurts sales. While Salesforce isn't alone in offering tools to build Agents — Microsoft, which competes with Salesforce in the CRM arena, also has them — the company clearly has a strategy. As a result, we're downgrading shares of Salesforce to a hold-equivalent 2 rating as we look to better understand to what extent Salesforce is being disrupted, or if can indeed adapt to the new world.

When he was arrested at a New York City Airbnb apartment in June 2024, he had over $37,000 in cash and nearly 1,500 stolen account access numbers in his possession, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. He worked with multiple people internationally in the scheme, with one accomplice receiving more than 36,000 stolen EBT card numbers from Graur over the course of three years, the statement said. Advertisement In 2023, The Times reported on a string of Romanian citizens who had been arrested for skimming EBT funds through ATMs, including Virgil Negru, a member of the Eforie City Council, who was charged with felony forgery and identity theft. But that changed in California in April, when the state rolled out new cards with microchips, said Gerry Bonilla, the division chief for program compliance in the state’s Social Services Department. Customers cannot be reimbursed twice in one Federal Fiscal Year and the amount “cannot exceed the equivalent of two months’ worth of their monthly allotment per occurence,” Bonilla said in an email. Separately, another person, also from Romania, plead guilty to bank fraud and asylum fraud in San Francisco for the same type of scam with EBT cards, according to another DOJ statement.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israel’s military targeted an Al Jazeera correspondent with an airstrike Sunday, killing him, another network journalist and at least six other people, all of whom were sheltering outside Gaza City's largest hospital complex. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif's death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that it was appalled by the strike. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group's regional director, said in a statement.

Article: “At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” Trump said at a White House press conference that he called to announce plans for a federal takeover of Washington’s police force to help combat crime. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he expected to determine mere moments into his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week whether it would be possible to work out a deal to halt the war in Ukraine. He said he thought Friday’s sitdown with Putin in Alaska would be “really a feel-out meeting.” Trump added that “it’ll be good, but it might be bad” and predicted he may say, “lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.” READ MORE: What to know about the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska Putin wants to lock in Russia’s gains since invading Ukraine in February 2022 as Trump presses for a ceasefire that has remained out of reach. The Trump-Putin meeting so far isn’t going to include Zelenskyy Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, “The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin” but it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow. To that point, Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to “tell them what kind of a deal — I’m not going to make a deal. It’s not up to me to make a deal.” Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Trump’s up and down relations with Putin More recently, Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn’t appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn’t done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday’s meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow’s sphere of influence. Europeans will prepare with a virtual meeting on Ukraine this week With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday. The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and “related issues of territorial claims and security.” Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles (418 kilometers) east of Moscow. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Article: Barcelona’s domination of Real Madrid last season resulted in Los Blancos bringing an end to Carlo Ancelotti’s second tenure – even though he had delivered a league and European double a year previous. Rumours rumbled for most of the season, after a low-key start at home and abroad, that former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso would be making the switch from Bayer Leverkusen to replace Ancelotti. With their La Liga and UEFA Champions League defence over, the Madrid-based club wasted little time in announcing Alonso, conveniently at a time when Brazil cranked up their interest in Ancelotti. The first match of the new Spanish campaign is on Friday, August 15 and sees Girona, who finished only a point above the relegation zone last season, entertain a Rayo Vallecano side that claimed ninth spot in La Liga last year. It has been a quiet transfer window for Barcelona, whose finances had been heavily in the spotlight last year with La Liga rules limiting spending on wages and transfers – complicating the registration of Dani Olmo. The Spanish international arrived from RB Leipzig in Germany for a fee of $62.5m in the summer of 2024, but was nearly forced into a free transfer away from the Catalan club due to their dire financial situation. The loan of Marcus Rashford, who made his debut in the 5-0 pre-season demolition of Como, from Manchester United is Barca’s only major addition in the off season to their ranks so far. A 4-0 demolition of Real in Madrid on October 26 kicked off the derbies last season, the first major warning signs that Los Blancos may have a turbulent ride ahead. That defeat for Ancelotti’s side was compounded by a 5-2 hammering in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, before a 3-2 Copa Del Rey final win for Barca in late April left Real facing up to the prospect of a trophyless season. The lack of any major additions to Barcelona’s title-winning squad will throw doubt on whether manager Hansi Flick will be able to push the players to go again without further competition for places. Flick’s side will be fully expected to put up a stern defence of their La Liga title and to go all the way in the Champions League, a competition they were heavily favourites to win last season until their shock semifinal elimination by Inter Milan. Real Madrid will have to cope with the loss of Luka Modric in midfield, only a year after the retirement of Toni Kroos – an absence believed to have heavily contributed to Real’s demise last season. Nonetheless, the link-up between an attack and midfield, which is now missing both of its mainstays for more than a decade, will be the major problem for Alonso to solve. Alongside fellow countryman Julian Alvarez, France and Atletico legend Antoine Griezmann, and Giuliano Simeone, the son of the manager, Almada could well sprinkle the magic needed to elevate Atletico to the top of the pile.

Article: Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County? The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 — on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas. (Aung Shine Oo / Associated Press) Advertisement “It came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,” said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech. Geological Survey) Advertisement The magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine’s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. “It’s not going to come soon, because it’s quite a heavy calculation.” Still, such simulations would provide a model of “all possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.” Rescuers work at the site of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, that collapsed after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake centered in Myanmar on March 28. Or it could be a much larger earthquake — rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. By comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake’s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley — related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7. But while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike. “It is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.” A Buddhist monk walks near a collapsed pagoda on March 30 after an earthquake in central Myanmar. stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.” “And then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,” Avouac said. The entire length of the Sagaing fault — including areas that didn’t rupture in the March earthquake — is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate. These maps show the 317 miles of the Sagaing fault that ruptured in March, compared to the historical ruptures, as outlined in a 2016 study, of the San Andreas fault in California in 1730, 1812, 1857 and 1906. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956. “There’s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.” Advertisement There is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a “Big One” simply won’t ever strike California again. “If there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won’t hold forever.” Further research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said. The other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.

Article: (AP) — The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. “Some water did come in, it’s stinky water, we think it’s sewage, but we’ll be OK.” The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon’s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he’s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters in an inflatable boat on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away as the Root River flooded a road in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee.

Article: As punishment for flouting her order and being found in civil contempt, the judge required Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to file bimonthly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions have been made under the law. In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report. In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law. “ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

Article: The Israeli military last year accused six Al Jazeera journalists — including Anas al-Sharif whom Israel said it had targeted in its attack on Gaza City on Sunday — of being fighters with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. Al Jazeera denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence.” The Israeli military in 2024 killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza, claiming he was a member of Hamas’s military wing, along with a cameraman, Rami al-Rifee, who was not accused of involvement with the militant group. Al Jazeera called the accusation “baseless.” Israel has banned all foreign journalists from independently entering Gaza to cover the war since the conflict was ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. As a result, Al Jazeera’s Palestinian correspondents in Gaza have provided much of the on-the-ground coverage of the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and led to mass privation and hunger in the enclave.

Article: If the deadline had passed, duties on Chinese goods would have returned to where they were in April at 145 percent, further fuelling tensions between the world’s two largest trading partners. While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, reaching prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling global trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower tariffs at a meeting between negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland. The relationship is very good with [China’s] President Xi [Jinping] and myself.” “We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian in a statement. Even as both countries appeared to be seeking to push back the reinstatement of duties, US trade envoy Jamieson Greer said last month that Trump will have the “final call” on any such extension. Ongoing negotiations Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump’s first term and now with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said she expected Trump to extend the 90-day “tariff detente” for another 90 days later on Monday. “The whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations, and there’s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,” she said.

Article: Trump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”. ‘Represent ourselves’ The rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia. Advertisement The city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.” In March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.” For many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community. Amari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. For his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”. Among those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.” “There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said. While DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data. Groups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”. Twenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”. Tanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred. ‘Best place for us to resist’ Maurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime. “When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.” “It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”

Article: At the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky this morning, Ford executives announced that they plan to retool the factory so they can roll out a midsize pickup truck in the $30,000 range within 18 months. This has long been the goal for a number of automakers: a truly affordable EV — one that competes with gas cars when it comes to the upfront sticker price, without factoring in government subsidies or the savings from gasoline. And they fizzled out." But after canceling its large electric SUV and just recently delaying a next-generation of electric full-size trucks and vans, Ford held this splashy event in Louisville to make it clear it was moving forward — really — with this project. Political headwinds, global realities Technically, what Ford announced is not just a single vehicle but a vehicle platform, which will eventually be adapted into a variety of vehicles that are all built the same way. The Kentucky plant, which currently makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will close for renovations and retooling, and reopen with 2,200 jobs, 600 fewer people than it employs now. Demand for battery-powered cars has come in lower than carmakers' expectations, and with federal tax credits expiring at the end of September , that trend is expected to slow even more. In a nod to those past challenges, Ford executives repeatedly said the new vehicle had to be "sustainable" — a reference not to the environmental benefits of EVs, but to the need for the car to be sustainable as a business proposition. And, at risk of understatement, companies don't always make their initial price targets; the F-150 Lightning and the Cybertruck were both first promised to start at $40,000, a price they never actually hit. Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research at the automotive insights firm Telemetry, said that while there's no guarantee that Ford can pull this off, the new price target is "plausible." "Most of what we know so far about what Ford is doing is not actually entirely new" for the EV industry, he said. Ford plans on reducing costs and complexity by using a small number of very large die-cast metal pieces for a truck's body, instead of a large number of small pieces; that's an innovation Tesla pioneered. And while he made promises about high-tech features and the future, executives also told workers in the plant they could look forward to a more mundane benefit from the $2 billion investment: When the plant reopens next year, Ford VP Bryce Currie told the assembled workers, it would have tempered air — and a much cooler temperature.

President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. crackdown Analysis by Jonathan Allen Donald Trump isn’t the first president to deploy troops and federal agents in the name of safeguarding the nation’s capital, but he has been particularly selective about what represents a threat to the peace. In the summer of 2020, Trump amassed a heavily armed force in Lafayette Square, steps from the White House, and unleashed it on peaceful protesters demonstrating against unprovoked police violence. In appointing himself Washington’s top cop, he promised to clean up a city that he described as having been “overtaken” by “bloodthirsty criminals.” Attorney General Pam Bondi went a step further, vowing that “crime in D.C. That should make it easier for Trump to keep this promise — he can just take credit for what was already in motion — than the ones that have fallen short: ending inflation and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, among others. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was overrun by drug lords — the mayor at the time was arrested after he was caught smoking crack cocaine — and it was known as the murder capital of the world. In the meantime, he has portrayed himself again as a proponent of “law and order” — so long as it serves his political ends — which could allow him to position himself to take credit for a relatively safe and prosperous city, and leave Democrats to fight over how much crime-fighting is too much. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images To better understand how two candidates as ideologically opposed as President Donald Trump and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani could rise to prominence, just ask Ray. (Ray declined to share his last name out of concern that he could face backlash for his political views.) I first spoke with Ray in January when we reached out to some of the swing voters who propelled Trump to victory last year. “But he makes the effort to go out and talk to people and reach out to people and try to actually do things that are better for the working class.” The son of Asian immigrants, Ray has not always been tuned into politics. He registered as a Democrat to have a say in the deep blue city’s politics and because the party supported policies he benefitted from as a kid, like public education, school lunches and afterschool programs. “When I was voting for Biden, it was the expectation that things will go back to normal,” Ray said, later adding, “The problem is we never really got the normalcy.” So he cast his ballot for Trump in 2024, the first time he had ever supported a Republican. “It’s not about Republicans or Democrats in my mind,” Ray said, adding that he is drawn to a candidate “who is honest, who’s authentic, and someone who has the benefits of the little person in the back of their mind.” “I think having that’s important, and I think that’s what’s missing in the politics these days,” he said. 🗞️ Today's other top stories 🌏 Russia-Ukraine latest: Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the war.

Article: DALLAS — North Texas' ongoing population boom means more hospitals and medical facilities are needed to meet the region's healthcare needs -- particularly as rural hospitals around the state and beyond struggle financially. John Henderson of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals recently warned that a third of the 157 rural hospitals in Texas have less than 10 days' cash on hand. "In some of the rural areas, the hospitals are struggling from a financial point of view, a cash-flow point of view and, as a result, they may have to cut back services, which creates a gap, or they may even have to close units," DFW Hospital Council CEO Steve Love said. "Some of the rural hospitals in Texas, unfortunately, have closed labor and delivery because of not having enough physicians, and not having the staff." To help fill gaps in healthcare access and accommodate steep growth in the population centers of North Texas, a number of new medical facilities have either recently opened or are in the works across the northern sectors of the Metroplex. Aside from building new hospitals, Love said he expects North Texas will also see more outpatient clinics and "probably as much focus as possible on telemedicine," as the population continues to grow. So here’s a look at the different facilities major health systems have recently opened or are coming soon to North Texas -- and how the entities behind these new facilities are deciding where to put them. Map of hospitals and facilities recently opened or in the works in North Texas Baylor Scott & White Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest nonprofit health system in Texas, officially opened Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Frisco at PGA Parkway, a new 340,000-square-foot, 84-bed hospital, earlier this summer. "Baylor Scott & White is committed to expanding access to high-quality care built on a legacy of clinical excellence," said Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Frisco at PGA Parkway President Ryan Gebhart when asked when the facility brings to the table. "As North Texas continues to grow, this new medical center is poised to meet the needs of a thriving region." Baylor Scott & White – Frisco at PGA Parkway Chief Medical Officer Eric Beshires said the new facility was designed to continue to meet the needs of North Texas into the future. "As we enter our third decade of Baylor Scott & White's service within the City of Frisco, we are committed to continuing to grow with the community to meet the changing needs of this area." Medical City Medical City Healthcare has expansion projects in the works across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a particular focus on fast-growing Collin County and Fort Worth, the 11th largest city in the country. "As the North Texas region continues to grow and evolve, Medical City Healthcare is strategically expanding to ensure families have access to the essential services they need, including emergency care, mental healthcare, hospital services, and specialized programs," Medical City spokesperson Janet St. "Expansion is focused on underserved communities or areas experiencing rapid population growth, where we can make the greatest impact on community health and provide timely, expert and compassionate care close to home." In the last five years, Medical City says the health system has invested more than $1.7 billion in everything from building acquisitions and expansion to facility enhancements and technology. Medical City Mental Health & Wellness Center Alliance – a 65,000-square-foot, single-story hospital providing inpatient and outpatient services at 3100 Alliance Town Center in Fort Worth – opened in February to provide access to inpatient mental healthcare in the area. That same year, Medical City bought Medical City Mental Health and Wellness Center Frisco at 5680 Frisco Square Boulevard, and Medical City Sachse, a campus of Medical City Plano at 4750 President George Bush Highway that provides 24/7 emergency care. In 2023 Medical City acquired Medical City Decatur, a campus of Medical Center Denton at 609 Medical Center Drive, which is a full-service, acute care hospital with 150 beds, with the goal of "maintaining vital hospital access in a more rural community." This year, work is underway on a new, three-story patient tower at Medical City Arlington that will add 60 more patient care beds, bringing the total thee to 496. The space will house a 28-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit, specially-equipped ICU beds for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (an advanced life support therapy for patients whose heart or lungs are not functioning properly) and shell space for additional beds in the future. Finally, Medical City McKinney is planning a three-story expansion of its own that will add 28 more patient beds for a total of 357, plus four operating rooms, a new post-anesthesia care unit and additional space for day surgery. And Medical City Plano is expanding with 60 more patient beds, bringing the total there to 663, as well as three rooftop helipads, a three-story parking garage and shell space for future patient beds. Located about 40 miles north of downtown Dallas, Celina was the fastest-growing American city among cities and towns with a population of at least 20,000 between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the U.S Census Bureau. We run to it." Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs said the facility is the third-largest employer in the city, aside from the school district and the city itself, with about 250 full time employees. "Just having that facility in its close proximity really lends itself to quality patient care to our residents and the residents of the surrounding area." Before it opened, EMS had to transport patients to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in McKinney, about 14 miles from Celina, which is also expanding. "You may think that a lot of these hospitals are competitors with each other, but I think what I see from behind the scenes is you have very much relationships where they want to work together, where it's really about the patient." Texas Health Resources To help meet the increasing need for services in the area, Texas Health Resources is building the first full-service hospital in Forney. “There is a need with the fast growth in population in the Forney area to really expand care,” said Toya White, who serves as president at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Kaufman and will serve as president of the future Texas Health Hospital Forney. Expanding access to care is something that we’re always evaluating, and really how to meet our population demands.” A spokesperson for the city of Forney said the facility will provide essential services as well as jobs to the community. Along with strong commercial growth, the addition of a world-class, full-service healthcare facility like Texas Health Resources is a tremendous step for Forney," Forney spokesperson Zach Smith said in a statement. "This hospital will not only provide essential services to our residents but will also create high-quality jobs." Texas Health Resources Senior Executive Vice President Laura Irvine said the health system considers population and other demographics when considering where and what types of healthcare facilities are needed in an area. What are the healthcare services that they need, healthcare utilization and what are those current access points.” Beyond demographics, Irvine said Texas Health considers advances in technology to determine what services are needed. We want to make sure we’re matching not just the population and volume of the growth but the type of healthcare needs that they will have.” Irvine said Texas Health has seen the use of e-visits, or virtual visits, increase about threefold in the last year. Explained Irvine: “We’ll want to work with them, make sure they know the services that we’ll be providing from Day 1, and how we’ll work with their EMS and ambulance services that will hopefully provide for them a much faster access for their ambulances than where they are currently driving to." Irvine said the health system also partners with cities and school districts where they plan to build facilities. One example Irvine shared: Texas Health Resources, Forney ISD and the Forney Education Department are partnering on community events and health and wellness initiatives like a Forney ISD back-to-school rally. As health systems plan for new hospitals, Irvine said they work to ensure they have enough land to expand to in the future and that they have planned out where new patient towers or other expansions could go. Late last year, Texas Health Resources also bought 21 acres of land in fast-growing Collin County at the northwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and the Collin County Outer Loop in Celina with plans of expanding there in the future as well. UT Southwestern UT Southwestern broke ground in May on a $177 million radiation oncology campus in Fort Worth to meet a growing need for cancer treatment, officials with the health system said. The 65,000-square-foot facility in Fort Worth's Medical District will include the city’s first MRI-guided precision radiation treatment, four linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation treatment (plus space for two more) and a fully-equipped brachytherapy suite to provide high-dose radiation treatments for patients with prostate or gynecologic cancers. The pediatric health complex will be located on more than 33 acres at the corner of Harry Hines Boulevard and Paul Bass Way, and it will reportedly replace the existing Children’s Medical Center Dallas. In addition to 24-hour nursing care, the hospital will offer physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as private rooms, a therapy gym, an in-house dialysis suite, a dining room, and pharmacy. JPS Health Network, Cook Children's Health Network, the city of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, LVTRise and WestAid Food Pantry have partnered to bring a 40,000-sq-ft health center to the neighborhood, with the ribbon-cutting held August 5 at 2800 S. “The collaboration that has gone into this center is what truly makes it so special, and I’m really honored to say that Cook Children’s is a part of it,” said Rick W. Their fingerprints are all over this project and will continue to guide how we evolve in this space to best serve them.” The neighborhood health center marks the first time JPS Health Network and Cook Children's have partnered to offer healthcare in one facility.

"However, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities." Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on July 28, before he killed himself, authorities said. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested that he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be diagnosed only by examining the brain after a person dies.

Article: DAKAR, Senegal — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: How it was found Sotheby’s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

While the use of the military on American streets is alarming, it should be just as scary how blatantly this president is tying race not just to crime, but to violence so uncontrollable it requires military troops to stop it. It’s a big part of American history and our justice system has unfortunately been steeped in it, from the Jim Crow era to the 1990s war on drugs, which targeted inner cities with the same rhetoric that Trump is recycling now. Trump pointed out some tragic and horrific examples — including the beating of Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, a former employee of the president’s Department of Government Efficiency who was attacked after attempting to defend a woman during a carjacking recently, not far from the White House. But the exploitation we are seeing from Trump is a dangerous precedent to justify military force for domestic law enforcement, which until now has been forbidden — or at least assumed forbidden — by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. While it’s uncertain how that case will resolve, “Los Angeles could provide a bit of a road map for any jurisdiction seeking to push back against the Trump administration when there’s a potential threat of sending in federal troops,” Jessica Levinson, a constitutional legal scholar at Loyola Law School, told me.

Article: The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the “obsolete” H20 chip to China. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,” Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. “Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.” The top Democrat on the panel also raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.” Rep.

Article: Iran’s talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be “technical” and “complicated”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said, ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with it last month in the wake of the June conflict triggered by Israeli strikes. Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that a meeting may be organised with Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi during the IAEA’s visit, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks”. The IAEA’s visit marks the first to Iran since President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country on July 3 to suspend its cooperation with the nuclear watchdog after an intensive 12-day war with Israel. Pezeshkian told Al Jazeera in an interview last month that his country is prepared for any future war Israel might wage against it, adding that he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries. Relations between the IAEA and Iran deteriorated after the watchdog’s board said on June 12 that Iran had breached its non-proliferation obligations, a day before Israel’s air strikes over Iran, which sparked the conflict. “Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes, and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Araghchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past, in negotiations with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear programme will resume, if at all.

"I'm so angry and I'm so disappointed and I'm heartbroken and I was always heartbroken at the thought of losing this library and losing the staff." Community members Ashley Grossman and Caitlin Dolt, who are both part of a "Friends of Skillman Southwestern Library" group, are preparing to fight the closure again, too. "It's time to do exactly what we did last year again." The proposed budget reflects the city's commitment to public safety, with plans to hire 350 police recruits and retain seasoned officers with a goal of ending the fiscal year with 3,424 sworn police officers. "There just has to be a balance somewhere and there has to be a limit at some point." The repeated fight for the library's survival has taken an emotional toll on residents. The budget documents show the city plans to evaluate closing up to four more library branches in the 2026-2027 budget year as the library system moves to "regionalize" library services.

Article: Ralph Norman admitted that Trump’s tariffs are already causing higher prices, but told the American people it’s “for the good of the country.” The South Carolina Republican’s comments were met with immediate criticism, including from “The Weekend” co-hosts Jonathan Capehart and Eugene Daniels, who discussed the impact of Trump’s trade war with fellow MSNBC host Ali Velshi on Sunday. After playing a clip of Norman’s remarks, Capehart pointed out the glaring hypocrisy: “I’m sorry, wait — he said it’s for the good of the country that costs are higher? They just beat the hell out of Joe Biden when he was president because of high prices.” Daniels said Norman showed that Republicans are “accepting the reality” of his trade war. Velshi chimed in and called the tariffs “nonsensical,” going on to say the real losers are America’s small businesses, who have “no leverage.” He added: “They have no lobbying, they have no ability to negotiate, they have no ability to even determine what boat their stuff gets on. Farmers, ranchers — any small business, they can’t do this.” Velshi also discussed Trump’s “dangerous” threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, pointing out “two very distinct problems.” He explained: “Every major industrialized country has a central bank, and they all follow similar rules to make sure that the person who’s the head of the government doesn’t influence. And the problem here is that he wants to influence that.” The second problem, Velshi said, is that “inflation is a much harder problem to handle than recession.” When it comes to a recession, “the government can put money into the economy. It almost wrecked America’s future in the ’80s.” Velshi pointed out that the president has tried to exert this level of control across the government but said the scale of his attacks on the Fed is a cause for grave concern: “This is what Donald Trump is doing all over government, but he’s doing it writ large here and it’s really dangerous.”

Article: CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks Monday in a famine-stricken displacement camp outside of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, killing 40 people, local rights groups said. The Emergency Response Rooms group working at the Abu Shouk displacement camp said in a statement on Facebook that the RSF — which is at war with the Sudanese military — raided parts of the camp targeting citizens inside their homes. Meanwhile, the Resistance Committees in el-Fasher confirmed the attacks, saying on Facebook that the scene “reflected the extent of the horrific violations committed against innocent, defenseless people.” The Resistance Committees are a group of local citizens from the community that includes human rights activists. “Our forces repelled a large-scale attack from several axes by the terrorist militia and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in lives and equipment, as more than 16 combat vehicles were destroyed and burned and 34 vehicles, including armored cars, were captured,” the army claimed in a statement. Meanwhile, in North Kordofan province the RSF has been accused of displacing over 3,000 families from 66 villages due to fighting since early August, according to the Sudan Doctors Network.

Article: The Times reached out to two sources with scenarios that challenge conventional thinking — two plans for the San Fernando Valley, which, half a century ago, provided the space for much of the city’s growth. Vestiges of Reseda’s small-town beginning still survive in block after block of single-story businesses like the Traders pawnbroker and jewelry store at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way. How many more of those would be needed for Reseda, or any similar community, to contribute its fair share of the state’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the city of Los Angeles? The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. Here's how the Pacific Urbanism hybrid model could work The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. 1 MILE The low-density area could see a variety of new building sizes with the largest added along the main corridors At the moment the majority of the structures are one to four unit properties. Those changes have helped, but don’t “get us anywhere close to what’s needed to meet the target, much less in an equitable way where all communities contribute a fair share,” Alvarez said. Pacific Urbanism proposes upgrading the zoning from medium- to high-density near the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way and creating medium-density zones to replace much of what is now single-family residences and small businesses. Bury the transmission lines; build on top If you’ve spent time in the San Fernando Valley, it would be easy to view the overhead electrical transmission lines that stretch for more than 20 miles simply as essential wallpaper of modern living. The lines help ensure that 1.6 million households and businesses across the city can turn on the lights through a mostly uninterrupted band of 100- to 200-foot tall towers on a 150-foot wide strip of land.

Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton's request for a temporary injunction, barring O'Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. SEE ALSO: Texas House Democrats remain out of state as redistricting showdown continues In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton's contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either "directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators" to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for "unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators' Constitutional duties." O'Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in the El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O'Rourke said Paxton was trying to "make examples out of those who fight so that others won't." "Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump, and Abbott have on power in Texas," O'Rourke said.

Article: Donald Trump’s gambits to strong-arm American companies to conform with his political agenda — be they law firms, universities or chip manufacturers — have exposed the fundamental disdain for democratic principles now being practiced by the party of “free enterprise.” Tan is the latest target. Tan visited the White House on Monday, a meeting that followed a post from Trump’s Truth Social account last week accusing him of being “conflicted” and demanding that he resign “immediately.” As Media Matters researcher Matt Gertz noted, the post from Trump’s account came minutes after a Fox Business report on a letter sent by Sen. (Tan, who was born in Malaysia, joins TikTok CEO Shou Chu as a target of Cotton’s Joseph McCarthy-esque crusade against businesspeople with ties to China.) In the letter, Cotton referred to Reuters’ reporting on Tan’s private investments and his previous job at Cadence, a tech company that recently reached a settlement in which it pleaded guilty to illegally selling semiconductor design technology to a Chinese military university. (A spokesperson for Intel told Reuters that Tan had answered questionnaires that included “disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest” and that the company handles such conflicts “appropriately.”) After Monday’s meeting, another post from Trump’s Truth Social account referred to Tan’s rise as an “amazing story” and said Tan and White House Cabinet members are going to “bring suggestions to me during the next week.” Intel released a statement calling the meeting “candid and constructive” and said the company appreciates “the President’s strong leadership.” But as the mercurial president wields his influence, it’s worth noting the facts don’t appear to be as scandalous as Trump or Cotton have implied. In a memo to staff published to Intel’s website Thursday, Tan denounced “misinformation” being spread about him and said he’s “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” The lack of any demonstrable culpability for Tan arguably highlights how blatantly authoritarian Trump’s push to oust him truly is. It’s certainly ironic that the president who eagerly welcomed Elon Musk into the fold despite his financial entanglements with China and their related national security concerns would turn around and insist that the business leader of an independent company must step down over his alleged ties to China.

Article: Trump ordered a takeover of Washington’s police President Trump said yesterday that he was temporarily taking control of the police force in Washington and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in the U.S. During a news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington, a city that he said had been taken over by “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth.” His remarks contrasted with official figures showing that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low. Trump added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” Trump has been threatening to take federal control of Washington for weeks, but he has railed against crime in largely liberal cities for decades. The Washington deployment is the latest example of Trump using the military to achieve his domestic goals; earlier this year, he sent 4,700 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles and deployed some 10,000 troops to the U.S.

AP Photo/Charlotte Kramon The shooter was stopped by CDC security guards before driving to a nearby pharmacy and opening fire late Friday afternoon, a law enforcement official has told the AP. Two CDC employees who were told about what was discussed at the meeting described details to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to reveal the information. Kennedy issued a statement Saturday that said "no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others," and that top federal health officials were "actively supporting CDC staff." He did not speak to the media during his visit Monday.

Years of false rhetoric about vaccines and public health was bound to "take a toll on people's mental health," and "leads to violence," said Tim Young, a CDC employee who retired in April.

Alexander McKellar offered to take her to the spot where the body was buried – and her quick thinking was crucial in cracking a case which had baffled police for three years. Tony's son Mike said that without Caroline's intervention, it was unlikely that his body would ever have been found – and expressed the family's gratitude for what she had done. Police Scotland Tony Parsons was described as a loving father, grandfather and friend Mike Parsons told BBC Scotland News that his dad was the kind of man who was always determined to complete any challenge he set himself. "I actually texted him myself, with what is my dad and myself's sense of humour, a simple text: 'Are you still alive?' "Looking back now, it's not nice to know that was the very last thing I texted to him, knowing at this point he would have been passed away." Caroline Muirhead became a key witness in a murder investigation after her boyfriend of two months confessed he killed a man.

Article: The number of people in immigration detention reached a new high of more than 60,000 on Monday, breaking a modern record set during the first Trump administration, according to internal records from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The number of detained people has jumped since January, when about 39,000 people were in immigration detention, reflecting efforts by the Trump administration to quickly ramp up arrests and deportations. The latest figures reflect the shifting focus of immigration policing: Most of the people detained in January had been arrested by Customs and Border Protection, the agency that patrols the nation’s land borders, seaports and airports.

Many ESG funds, which have historically swerved defense investments, appear to have shifted their stance on the sector amid rising geopolitical instability and commitments from Western governments to grow their security budgets. And actually, we don't think that the weighting for ESG funds in Europe has actually shifted that much, which I think is very interesting — we do feel as though a lot of that re-weighting of the European ESG asset basis is still to come." European defense stocks have had a year of blockbuster growth, amid commitments from regional governments and the NATO military alliance — whose members are largely European nations — to drastically ramp up defense spending.

Article: The Justice Department is pressing the high court to take a Second Amendment case about a federal law that bars firearm possession by a person who “is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” The issue is due for consideration in the court’s Sept. While Maxwell’s case is far from a sure thing for review — it takes four justices to agree, and they reject most petitions — the Second Amendment issue presents a more likely candidate, at least as it’s presented by the DOJ. In its petition in the case of Ali Danial Hemani — whose prosecution, the government said, is based on his “habitual use of marijuana” — the Trump administration urged the justices to grant review because a lower court said the gun law is unconstitutional. The petition said the high court “has recently and repeatedly reviewed decisions invalidating federal statutes even in the absence of a circuit conflict.” The administration also said there is such a circuit conflict, meaning different federal appeals courts around the country ruling on an issue differently, leaving it to the justices to resolve the dispute nationwide. Hemani’s case and the [appeals court] decision below”; they said that the 5th Circuit didn’t invalidate the federal law in all its applications and that there’s no circuit split needing resolution. Solicitor General John Sauer maintained that the appeal “presents an important Second Amendment issue that affects hundreds of prosecutions every year: whether the government may disarm individuals who habitually use unlawful drugs but are not necessarily under the influence while possessing a firearm.” Though the government’s petition is a plausible candidate for review, it’s ultimately up to the justices whether and when to step in. Notably, they haven’t taken every Second Amendment appeal presented to them over the years, to the chagrin of gun rights advocates and some of the justices, such as Clarence Thomas, who lamented upon the court’s declining to consider a different gun appeal in June that the right to bear arms remains a “second-class” one without the court’s vigilance in enforcing it. Rahimi, a lopsided court ruled 8-1 that the Second Amendment permits temporarily disarming people who have been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another person.

Article: Sheila Jordan, a singular voice in jazz, has died Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Stewart Michael Stewart Sheila Jordan, one of the great underappreciated voices in jazz, has died at the age of 96. Despite a career that unfolded in fits and starts due to racial tensions, a troubled marriage and the challenges of single motherhood, Jordan recorded one of the most beloved vocal jazz records of the 1960s, Portrait of Sheila on Blue Note Records, and was recognized 50 years later by the National Endowment of the Arts as a Jazz Master, the genre's highest honor. "That's the one I'll dedicate my life to." Jordan, who was white, became good friends with Parker — he called her "the lady with the million dollar ears." In 1952, she married one of his close collaborators, Duke Jordan, and went on to work with many Black jazz artists, often facing prejudice from other white people because of it. "That's how I survived, knowing that once or twice a week I'd get a sitter for Traci, and I'd go and sing in this club, and then I'd get up the next morning and go do my day gig."

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File) MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls — the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon — out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. “We all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,” said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab. That’s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023. Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said “it’s very little,” but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals. So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year. Zambrano highlights that his team’s work has shown that conservation works and that the effort to protect the species is also improving water quality, increasing the number of pollinizers in the area and means that Mexico City makes better use of Xochimilco’s water, among other benefits.

At the time, that “D” rating was progress because in the 2019-2020 school year, the school received an “F” from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and risked having the state take over.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel — New video footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. B’Tselem says it obtained the video from the family of Awdah Hathaleen, 31, an activist, English teacher and father of three who was shot and killed on July 28, and who they said had filmed it. Levi, who is shown firing his gun twice in a video shot by another witness and obtained by The Associated Press, was briefly detained and then released from house arrest by an Israeli court, which cited lack of evidence. The shooting occurred in Umm al-Khair, a village that has long weathered settler violence in an area profiled in the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land.” Settler attacks on Palestinians have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as have attacks by Palestinian militants. “Awdah’s killing is another horrific example of how Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank, are currently living without any sort of protection, fully exposed to Israeli violence, while Israeli soldiers or settlers can kill them in broad daylight and enjoy full impunity while the world watches,” said Sarit Michaeli, the international outreach director for B’Tselem.

Article: Los Angeles Unified school police, staff and community volunteers will form protective perimeters around at least 100 schools when classes begin on Thursday to help ensure the safe passage of children — an announcement that came on a day that immigration agents reportedly handcuffed, detained and drew their guns on a student outside Arleta High School in a case of mistaken identity, officials said. “Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,” school board member Kelly Gonez, who represents Arleta High, said in a social media post. Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference near district headquarters, saying that the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding “safe zones” around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.” At least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools. Advertisement The public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, “all the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,” said Carvalho, with the goal of “explaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.” The district also has created a “compassion fund” to provide general help for families, including legal assistance. Los Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which, along with the City of Los Angeles, includes all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

Article: used to tell children in his youth group in Maryland that it was normal for a pastor to kiss boys on the lips, because that’s how Jesus greeted his disciples, according to an arrest warrant made public last week. Pinkerton, 52, a youth minister known as Pastor Tommy, is being held without bond following accusations that he sexually abused six teens from 2006 to 2010 while working at Central Christian Church, an Assemblies of God church in Baltimore County. He gave his life to the community, worked for the community,” Hollimon said, adding that he filed a motion Monday morning seeking another bond hearing for Pinkerton after a judge denied his release last week. “He’s anxiously waiting his day in court.” Pinkerton’s arrest comes as the Assemblies of God, the world’s largest Pentecostal denomination, with nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States, is grappling with a string of child sex abuse allegations. As part of an ongoing investigation into the denomination’s handling of abuse claims, NBC News published an investigation last week based on interviews, emails, court filings and police reports that examined how an Assemblies of God college ministry guided hundreds of students to the home of Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender lauded by some as “the holiest man alive.” Days later, Assemblies of God leaders addressed the issue of sex abuse in the denomination during a biennial gathering in Orlando, defending their handling of the Savala case while also pledging to make changes to prevent similar abuses in the future. The men alleged that when they were in their teens, Pinkerton would give them massages and rub their penises; several said Pinkerton would greet them with what he referred to as a “heavenly kiss” or “brotherly kiss” on the lips, likening this to Jesus. Assemblies of God officials distanced themselves from Pinkerton on Monday, telling NBC News that, although Pinkerton worked at an Assemblies of God church, he was never formally credentialed as a minister with the denomination. “We are so saddened to hear of this report, and are deeply concerned whenever reports like this come out,” said Benjamin Rainey Jr., secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God regional office that oversees the three-state region that includes Maryland. In a statement posted last week on its website, Central Christian said Pinkerton served on its staff more than 15 years ago and hasn’t been affiliated with the church since he left to start his own ministry. In the years since the alleged abuse occurred, Pinkerton has preached in at least six different states, NBC News found, and according to his ministry website, he has evangelized in South America, Europe and Asia. One church where he preached, the New Chapel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is not an Assemblies of God church, posted on its website over the weekend that it had cut ties with Pinkerton before he was arrested. “We were heartbroken to hear of these serious allegations that occurred in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 20 years ago, and communicated the situation to our church family after severing all ties with the accused several months back.

Meanwhile, the national drought group - which includes the Met Office, regulators, the government, and water companies - has warned that England is now suffering from "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The group said England is experiencing widespread environmental and agricultural effects from the shortage of water, which is hitting crop yields, reducing feed for livestock, damaging river wildlife and wetlands, as well as increasing wildfires.

Article: The reconciliation bill President Donald Trump signed last month increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention budget by more than 300%, making the immigration enforcement machine’s budget comparable to that of some foreign armed forces. ICE has begun hiring thousands of new agents; it is trying to lure recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, and last week Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires. The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy. As we at the American Immigration Council laid out in a recent report, Trump’s second-term immigration policies, in just six months, represent an unprecedented and coordinated assault on democratic rights and principles. And despite the Fifth Amendment’s promise of due process, the administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s hellhole CECOT prison, based on vague, unchallengeable allegations of gang affiliation. In addition to hiring thousands of new ICE agents, the federal government is rapidly expanding detention capacity, filling private jails and converted military sites with thousands of people, most of whom have never been charged with a crime. In immigrant-heavy communities, people are afraid to report real crime — like in Tennessee, where, according to a police chief, a child may have died because their noncitizen caretaker was scared to call 911 given the recent immigration raids in the state. What’s left is a chilling message: No immigrant is safe, no matter their background, status or contribution to society — and mass deportation comes at any cost, including Americans’ safety.

Article: “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” President Trump claimed on Monday, despite falling crime in Washington. President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling. Trump took the lectern in the White House briefing room and said he also intended to clear out the capital’s homeless population, without saying how officials would do it, or detailing where those people would go. 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 ’21 ’23 ’25 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 Instead, Mr. Federal officials were still working out many of the operational details of the president’s plan on Monday afternoon, even though small groups of agents had been conducting limited patrols over the weekend. The effort envisions about 500 federal law enforcement officers, drawn from a host of agencies that operate in Washington, to be used for some version of patrol or support roles of the local police, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the still-developing plan. One complicating factor of using federal agents for essentially street-based police work is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses, so the current view among Trump administration officials is that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain them until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience, the “oceanfront property” in Ukraine and his coming trip to “Russia” — he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. “Why has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?” Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.” Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic.

Article: A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit established by Congress to bolster democracy worldwide that had been paralyzed by the loss of funding earlier this year. Friedrich of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in her 15-page ruling that the Trump administration had withheld funds from the nonprofit “for impermissible policy reasons,” and that the endowment had suffered irreparable harm in the form of layoffs of critical staff members and suspension of several democracy-supporting initiatives. “These harms to the endowment’s global reputation and to the ‘very existence of its programs’ are irreparable,” Judge Friedrich wrote, ordering the release of $95 million in federal funds to the nonprofit — roughly 30 percent of its annual budget. The endowment, which has been denounced by major authoritarian powers like China and Russia, was one of several U.S.-backed human rights groups that fell victim to aggressive cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency, a group led by Elon Musk that sought to slash much of the government soon after President Trump returned to office.

Article: The race for Detroit’s next mayor is set to pit a longtime City Council member against a popular pastor DETROIT -- The race for Detroit’s next mayor is set to pit a longtime City Council member against a popular pastor, after council President Mary Sheffield and megachurch leader Solomon Kinloch were the top two vote-getters in Tuesday’s nonpartisan primary. "We claimed it together, and, Detroit, I believe that our best days are ahead of us.” She said the primary win belongs to every boy or girl told to “dream small,” every neighborhood where people feel left behind, every senior who “paved the way” and every college student who wants to stay in the city. “It’s time we reckoned with reality, that far too many Detroiters feel left out.” The continued growth of the city could be at stake since Duggan, who is running for Michigan's governor in 2026 as an independent, has helmed Detroit as it exited the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. The next mayor will inherit a city on much firmer footing than the one Duggan was elected to lead in 2013 when an emergency manager installed by the state to oversee the city's flailing finances filed for bankruptcy on its behalf.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). “This is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,” Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. “In fact, it’s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.” The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia’s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday.

Article: Bank of America thinks the Federal Reserve may want to hold off on cutting interest rates at the end of its next FOMC meeting in the wake of the latest jobs report. "We think those FOMC members that argue for cuts don't put enough weight on the labor supply shock or the fact that inflation is stuck above target, with risks of a larger and more persistent shock after the latest tariff hikes," economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote on Monday. "Cutting in September may risk starting the easing cycle without evidence that inflation has peaked." He also said that he still doesn't expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. "The downward revision to nonfarm payrolls increases the probability of what we view as the most likely alternate scenario: 'bad cuts,' due to deterioration in the labor market," Irigoyen wrote.

Article: Bill Essayli’s request to dismiss charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who has already been convicted of a felony for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest, ordering him to start his prison sentence this month. Wilson said the government’s effort to overturn a jury conviction was “contrary to the public interest.” The ruling brought to a close a criminal case involving an unusual post-trial plea agreement, which triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May and ultimately saw the felony reduced to a misdemeanor. Advertisement In an 11-page ruling, Wilson cited a lack of new evidence or change in circumstances of the case in denying the motion to in effect erase the prosecution of L.A. But after Essayli, a staunch supporter of President Trump, was named top federal prosecutor for the area in April, he ordered a review of the case and sought its unraveling. Advertisement A federal jury found Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law after he violently threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023. “Indeed, after the Court rejected its request for probation and imposed a custodial sentence, the Government responded by seeking to dismiss all charges — ensuring Defendant serves no time at all.” A spokesman for the U.S. Caree Harper, who has served as a victim’s rights attorney for the woman Kirk was convicted of assaulting, celebrated the ruling as a minor victory in the face of Essayli’s broader assault on the case. Late last month, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the judgment against Kirk, citing “misgivings about the case.” They also moved to drop charges in another controversial criminal case, involving Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains. The motions to dismiss came the same day that the Trump administration moved to extend Essayli’s term as L.A.’s top federal law enforcement official, despite flouting the normal confirmation process for prosecutorial appointees. “There’s nothing left.” Essayli’s decision to offer the deputy a lenient postconviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections. Faerstein told jurors Kirk used excessive force against Houseton by slamming her to the ground and pepper-spraying her “when it was unnecessary to do so.” Kirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded. In handing down the four-month sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury’s view, Kirk’s actions were “just plain inexplicable.” He said that Kirk “knew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,” before he pepper-sprayed Houseton. Keenan told the judge that the office found no new evidence but argued not enough attention had been paid to “acts of resistance.” “Didn’t the jury see all that?” Wilson questioned. The jury saw all of it.” After the hearing last week, activists confronted Keenan in the hallway, telling him “this is bigger than Kirk.” Among them was Raycine Ector, the lead organizer of Cancel the Contract Antelope Valley, a community coalition advocating for ending contracts between the Sheriff’s Department and local cities and schools.

Article: The law, Senate Bill 37, is part of a broader effort by Republican lawmakers to assert more control over public universities following years of clashes with faculty over issues like tenure, diversity initiatives and academic freedom. Other university systems, including Texas A&M, University of Houston and University of North Texas, are taking steps to preserve their faculty senates and avoid a gap in faculty representation by restructuring them ahead of the Sept. The University of Houston System said it began planning for a new faculty council earlier this summer, and its board is scheduled to vote on the updated policies and bylaws in August. The Texas Tech University System has indicated it plans to retain its faculty senates in accordance with the new law, though it’s unclear what steps it has taken in that direction. “It’s a head-scratching moment to wonder how and why the effort looks so different,” said Joseph Velasco, a professor at Sul Ross State University, which is part of the Texas State University System. “It risks breaking the thread of shared governance that keeps the university healthy and accountable.” At Sul Ross, faculty who teach at least six credit hours a semester automatically become members of the faculty assembly, a body that functions like a faculty senate and advises the administration. Faculty senates, which have traditionally elected their own leaders and representatives, will look drastically different under SB 37, even at those universities opting to keep their faculty senates and adapt them to comply with the law. “Continuity matters because a functioning faculty senate serves as a check and balance within the university.” Mark Criley, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said the administration could also use the new faculty senates to make it appear as if they have faculty support when they do not. SB 37 requires faculty senates to broadcast their meetings when a majority of members are present, record attendance on critical votes, and post agendas seven days in advance, a stricter standard than the 72-hour requirement under the Texas Open Meetings Act. The law also allows university administrators to remove faculty senate members for “failing to conduct the member’s responsibilities within the council or senate’s parameters, failing to attend council or senate meetings or engaging in similar misconduct.” The law doesn’t define what qualifies as misconduct. Last year, more than 500 professors at Creighton’s alma mater, UT-Austin, signed a petition calling for the removal of then-President Jay Hartzell over his decision to have law enforcement respond to peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. Coby Condrey, a librarian who serves as chair of the UNT faculty senate, said that he expects to continue that strategy under SB 37, and that UNT’s administration will respond in kind. He anticipates the UNT System’s board of regents will authorize faculty senates at their meeting later this month, and said UNT President Harrison Keller has already agreed to consider faculty recommendations when selecting appointees. “We know that it is always going to be better for the faculty to have the administration at least hear our concerns, even if not all of the decisions might be the ones that we would prefer,” Condrey said. Disclosure: Southern Methodist University, Sul Ross University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, University of Houston, University of North Texas, University of Texas System and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: What we learnt from Nicola Sturgeon's memoir 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save BBC Nicola Sturgeon's memoir Frankly is now on sale, slightly earlier than expected after newspaper serialisations and interviews teased some tantalising extracts. Spindrift Isla Bryson was jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape Sturgeon also addresses the case of double rapist Adam Graham who was initially sent to a female prison after self-identifying as a woman called Isla Bryson. "In football parlance, I lost the dressing room." Speaking to ITV News on Monday Sturgeon said she now believed a rapist "probably forfeits the right" to identify as a woman. JK Rowling JK Rowling posted a selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Sturgeon as a "destroyer of women's rights" The former first minister also criticises her highest profile opponent on the gender issue, Harry Potter author JK Rowling, for posting a selfie in a T-shirt bearing the slogan "Nicola Sturgeon, destroyer of women's rights". Her relationship with Alex Salmond Sturgeon's mentor and predecessor as first minster, Alex Salmond, is mentioned dozens of times in the book, often in unflattering terms which reflect their estrangement after he was accused of sexual offences. Salmond won a judicial review of the Scottish government's handling of complaints against him and in 2020 was cleared of all 13 charges but his reputation was sullied by revelations in court about inappropriate behaviour with female staff. "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy," she writes, adding: "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all". The campaign was tough, she says, partly because of what she calls unbalanced coverage by the British media including the BBC and partly because Salmond left her to do much of the heavy lifting. PA Media Sturgeon claims Alex Salmond showed little interest in the "detail" of the independence white paper A key period in the lead-up to the poll was her preparation, as deputy first minister, of a white paper setting out the case for independence. Getty Images Sturgeon described her house as looking like a murder scene Text here Leading Scotland during the pandemic For Sturgeon, the coronavirus pandemic which struck the world five years ago still provokes "a torrent of emotion". She says she will be haunted forever by the thought that going into lockdown earlier could have saved more lives and, in January 2024, after she wept while giving evidence to the UK Covid inquiry, she "came perilously close to a breakdown". PA Media Nicola Sturgeon appeared visibly upset when giving evidence to the Covid Inquiry Text here Misogyny and sexism Scathing comments about the inappropriate behaviour of men are scattered throughout the book. "Like all women, since the dawn of time, I have faced misogyny and sexism so endemic that I didn't always recognize it as such," Sturgeon writes on the very first page. Sturgeon says a male MSP from a rival party taunted her with the nickname "gnasher" as he spread a false rumour that she had injured a boyfriend during oral sex. Nicola Sturgeon says she may have appeared to be a confident and combative leader but underneath she is a "painfully shy" introvert who has "always struggled to believe in herself." She writes in detail about the "excruciating pain" and heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage after becoming pregnant at the age of 40. Sturgeon touches on the end of her marriage, saying "I love him" but the strain of the past couple of years was "impossible to bear." She also writes about her experience of the menopause, explaining that "one of my deepest anxieties was that I would suddenly forget my words midway through an answer" at First Minister's Question Time.

Article: Staff fear UK's Turing AI Institute at risk of collapse 4 hours ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Joshua Nevett Political reporter Share Save EPA Staff at the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence (AI) have warned the charity is at risk of collapse, after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle threatened to withdraw its funding. The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute "is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy". "The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be," they said. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year. The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking "substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI". A Charity Commission spokesperson said: "We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us." They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation. Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's "ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders".

Article: “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” President Trump claimed on Monday, despite falling crime in Washington. President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling. Trump took the lectern in the White House briefing room and said he also intended to clear out the capital’s homeless population, without saying how officials would do it, or detailing where those people would go. 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 ’21 ’23 ’25 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 Instead, Mr. Federal officials were still working out many of the operational details of the president’s plan on Monday afternoon, even though small groups of agents had been conducting limited patrols over the weekend. The effort envisions about 500 federal law enforcement officers, drawn from a host of agencies that operate in Washington, to be used for some version of patrol or support roles of the local police, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the still-developing plan. One complicating factor of using federal agents for essentially street-based police work is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses, so the current view among Trump administration officials is that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain them until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience, the “oceanfront property” in Ukraine and his coming trip to “Russia” — he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. “Why has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?” Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.” Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic.

Article: The bot, which has become widely embraced on X as a way for users to fact-check or respond to other users’ arguments, posted that it had been taken offline over various statements it made regarding U.S and global politics, ranging from claims of genocide in Gaza to discussions about homicide rates by race. At the time, the Grok account acknowledged the posts and said xAI “has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” In a statement posted on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologized “for the horrific behavior that many experienced.” “Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users,” the statement read. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.” In May, Grok was involved in another controversy when it brought up South African “white genocide” claims as responses to unconnected inquires. When users asked why Grok was issuing such responses, the chatbot said its “creators at xAI” instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa and the ‘kill the Boer’ chant, as they viewed it as racially motivated,” according to The Guardian. Grok also acknowledged the glitch, writing that it will "focus on relevant, verified information going forward.” Even with its troubles, Grok has become one of the most public and recognizable AI chatbots due to its integration within X, where it has become a go-to for people looking for context, information and fact-checking. In a series of responses Monday after it came back online, Grok repeatedly stated without prompting that its “account was suspended after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza.” The posts have since been removed.

Article: Just hours after President Donald Trump said he would deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C., a federal judge in San Francisco heard arguments Monday about whether the administration violated federal law when it mobilized troops to Los Angeles this summer. Gavin Newsom and to stop using the military “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law.” The federal government is arguing that the deployment of the National Guard and Marines was solely to support immigration officials, who were impeded by large-scale protests across the city in early June. In response, the Department of Defense ordered some 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as thousands of immigration activists and supporters marched in the streets and outside federal buildings to show their opposition to Trump's mass deportation effort. The state sued the Trump administration for what it called an unwarranted deployment and won an early victory from Breyer, who found the federal government had violated the 10th Amendment clarifying the balance of power between federal and state governments. The case, which is expected to continue through Wednesday, could set a precedent for how the Trump administration handles future deployments of federal troops in D.C., Baltimore and other cities led by Democratic mayors. (Newsom and Bass are Democrats.) “The factual question, which the court must address, is whether the military was used to enforce domestic law, and if so, whether there continues to be a threat that will be done again,” Breyer told the court. Harrington, who did not participate in or witness work in the field, said he raised concerns about the Posse Comitatus Act on June 7 during a task force briefing before federal forces arrived in Los Angeles. During questioning by state Deputy Attorney General Jane Reilley, Harrington said he worried that if the California National Guard was deployed, it would lose law enforcement authority because of the statute and be reduced to a supportive role. That was the case when federal forces accompanied immigration agents to separate operations at Los Angeles' MacArthur Park and a cannabis cultivation center in Camarillo, north of L.A., Harrington said. “The soldiers actually did not engage in any activity.” Prior to deploying at MacArthur Park on July 7, when federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out across the mostly empty space, Harrington received an intelligence report that did “not indicate a high-value target or threat to federal functions at this location,” he said. During an immigration enforcement action in Mecca, a desert community about 142 miles east of Los Angeles, approximately 300 task force soldiers were present, compared to 200 federal law enforcement agents, Sherman said. Breyer appeared to bristle on multiple occasions, at one point arguing with both Sherman and DOJ attorneys about whether federal forces can intervene any time people protest a law they dislike. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, testified that federal intervention was necessary because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd of 1,500 gathered outside the federal building on June 6 to protest immigration arrests. “That impacted our ability to conduct our missions.” Lawyers with the DOJ asked Breyer for a quick judgment at the end of the day, arguing that the state had failed to make its case.

Article: NEW YORK — AriZona Iced Tea's legendary 99-cent price tag may finally face its end after nearly three decades, as company leadership grapples with the financial impact of new aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Don Vultaggio, the founder and chairman of AriZona Beverage Company, told The New York Times he is reluctantly considering raising prices on the company's signature tallboy cans for the first time since 1997, when the iconic 99-cent price was established. Just over a year ago, Vultaggio affirmed his commitment to keeping the price at 99 cents for "the foreseeable future." "I hate even the thought of it," Vultaggio told The Times. "It would be a hell of a shame after 30-plus years." The potential price increase stems from the Trump administration's 50% tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, according to The Times. About 80% of the aluminum AriZona uses comes from recycled material produced in the United States, while the remainder is imported from Canada and now subject to the 50% import duty, The Times reported. Vultaggio told The Times that aluminum prices have been "dramatically bumped up because of this tariff talk," and he expects domestic aluminum manufacturers to raise their prices in response to the tariffs. The 73-year-old founder, whose childhood in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood shaped his approach to affordability, established AriZona's business model around three simple principles: make it taste good, make it look good and price it right. Vultaggio expressed hope to The Times that the tariff dispute will be resolved, but acknowledged that "at some point the consumer is going to have to pay the price" if it is not.

Article: BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out World-famous coral reefs along Western Australia's (WA) coast have suffered the worst bleaching on record after the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave, scientists say. Between last August and this May, warmer water temperatures led to significant heat stress on the reefs, causing many of the coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal. "The length and intensity of the heat stress, and its footprint across multiple regions, is something we've never seen before on most of the reefs in Western Australia," James Gilmour, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), said. In a new report, the Aims researchers found the 2024-25 season was the "most severe coral bleaching on record" for WA coral reefs across both the northwestern and central reefs.

But not long after, some bunnies that had been procured for the photo shoot with the would-be socialite were abandoned in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, unleashing a torrent of backlash toward the real Anna Sorokin, who in an interview with The New York Times on Monday said that she was not responsible for procuring the rabbits and was “horrified” when she learned that they had been ditched. Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy German heiress and landed in prison for nearly four years for swindling Manhattan’s elite, spent 18 months behind bars in immigration detention for overstaying her visa.

Article: “I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the conference in which he was joined by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control. “Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I’m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act… and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,” he said. “And nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.” According to a report by the news outlet Politico, federal law enforcement officers will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and national monuments. The “rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government”, the order states. “The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.” It also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president “on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia”. SAFE AGAIN 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/xJRIcgy4ld — The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 11, 2025 According to reports, the move seems to have been triggered by an assault involving Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer and protege of Elon Musk, who previously led DOGE. “If DC doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, days after the attack, with an image showing a shirtless Coristine with what appeared to be blood spattered on his face, body and trousers. “Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime,” Trump added. The mayor of Washington, DC, Bowser, questioned the effectiveness of deploying the National Guard to enforce local laws, saying that more funding for prosecutors would make a more meaningful difference.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has tapped an economist from a conservative think tank to lead a key statistics agency after firing its previous head over her role in the release of weak employment figures. Trump’s nomination of Antoni, who requires confirmation by the US Senate, comes after his firing of Erika McEntarfer earlier this month raised concerns about US government statistics remaining credible and free of political influence. Trump justified McEntarfer’s dismissal by claiming, without evidence, that the latest jobs report, which showed sharply slower jobs growth for May and June than previously estimated, had been “rigged” to make him look bad. After Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with Japan last month, Antoni described the agreement as “darn close” to perfect and the US president and his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as “artistic masters”. Last week, Antoni said in a social media post that there were “better ways to collect, process, and disseminate” economic data, and that the next head of the BLS would need to deliver “accurate data in a timely manner” to rebuild trust in the agency.

Article: You feel much safer.” Snider is among a half-dozen policing and military experts who told NBC News they were perplexed by President Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and order the National Guard to help fight crime in Washington, D.C. as a crime-infested hellscape and said Attorney General Pam Bondi would “take command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.” In making his case, Trump ticked off recent violent incidents in Washington, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern and the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, an original Department of Government Efficiency staffer known online as "Big Balls." “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump said. President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, from left, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from right, during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, on Monday. “However, we emphasize that federal intervention must be a temporary measure, with the ultimate goal of empowering a fully staffed and supported MPD to protect our city effectively.” Concern from former chiefs The announcement of the federal takeover was met with alarm by Art Acevedo, a retired police chief who led departments in Houston, Austin and Miami. “There’s no reason for it other than the political optics sought by the administration to pretend that crime is out of control and they are the saviors.” Trump said that he had appointed the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the head of the Metropolitan Police Department. At her own press conference later in the day, Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions “unsettling and unprecedented.” The attorney general of D.C., Brian Schwab, had also blasted the move and said that he was exploring legal options, but Bowser acknowledged that Trump had the authority to temporarily seize control of the police department. She noted, however, that “nothing about our organizational chart has changed.” Trump must notify certain members of Congress within 48 hours about the reason for taking over control of police and the estimated timeline for federal control, according to the D.C. They know where the violence occurs,” said Snider, who is an adjunct lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a policy director of criminal justice and civil liberties at the R Street Institute, a think tank in D.C. Daniel Hodges, one of dozens of Metropolitan Police Department officers who were brutalized during the riot and whose assailants were among those pardoned by Trump upon his return to office, woke up to the news that Trump had taken over the MPD after working an overnight shift.

Article: In a game full of familiar faces returning to the stadium formerly known as "The Juice Box" (Minute Maid Park), and now renamed Daikin Park, the Houston Astros beat the Boston Red Sox in a 7-6 victory on Monday night. "I never thought I would get the chance to put on this uniform again, and I'm blessed to do this again in front of all the fans here in Houston," Correa said. Bregman, who is now a member of the Red Sox, had a decorated career with the Astros including two World Series titles (2017 and 2022) , three All-Star selections, a Silver Slugger Award recipient, and a Golden Glove Award winner. In the game, Bregman, who is no stranger to the Astros' field, scored a two-run home run in the first inning off former teammate Cristian Javier, which gave Boston the early 2-0 lead. Besides the long-anticipated returns of a couple Astros players, Astros infielder Ramon Urias made a statement as he hit his first homerun with the team to give Houston the lead 7-2 in the fifth inning.
