Article: Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts. "You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump. If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, "This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy." "This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote. "If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote. The governor added that if the other states "call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same." Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps. That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

Article: May God be a witness against those who remained silent and accepted our killing, and against those who choked our breath and whose hearts were not moved by the scattered remains of our children and women, and who did nothing to stop the massacre our people have faced for more than a year and a half.” This is what Anas al-Sharif wrote in his “will” prepared four months before his martyrdom. It was posted on his social media account several hours after an Israeli strike killed him and journalists Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa at a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Last month, when Anas broke down on camera while reporting on the starvation, people told him: “Keep going, Anas, don’t stop, you are our voice.” And indeed, he was our voice. Anas is now gone, and I feel I was wrong to hope, wrong to believe in the justice of this world, watching him appeal – with eyes overflowing with tears – to a global conscience that proved to be low and selective. I wished the war had ended before you were martyred so I could go find you in Gaza and tell you that our voices had succeeded, they had reached to the outside world and driven change. For me, that means speaking, writing, and exposing the crimes of this bloody and brutal occupation … until the day you dreamed of, Anas – the day this genocide, the most horrific in modern history, ends.

Article: Although the motive of the suspected shooter — Patrick White, 30, from Kennesaw — remains unknown, he told a neighbor that he believed the Covid vaccines had made him sick, a source told NBC News on the condition of anonymity. For some employees, the shooting highlighted growing hostility toward public health officials, which they feel has been shaped by Kennedy’s long history of spreading vaccine misinformation, including the Covid vaccine. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Just last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines — the same technology used to develop Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed “mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy ”has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,” Nixon said, “not a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.” Kennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting. “There’s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that’s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,” CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. “People feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,” said one CDC employees who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions. An employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it’s not lost on them that Kennedy “has demonized our work.” In an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was “deeply unsettling,” especially for those working in Atlanta.

WATCH: New study highlights ‘grave, growing’ danger of plastic pollution to world’s health Benjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, designed the nearly 6 meter (18 foot) sculpture called the “Thinker’s Burden” and built it with a team. Standing by the sculpture, Maria Ivanova, an expert in international environmental governance, said it “wakes you up.” Ivanova is the co-director of the Plastics Center at Northeastern University in Boston. “And this is where I think art is absolutely critical to shift the needle on policy.” Delegates and tourists stopped to ask Von Wong about his work and pose for photos in front of it. Michael Bonser, head of the Canadian delegation, called the artwork “extraordinarily profound.” “It gives us a sense, every day, of what we need to be doing inside the room, what we need to walk out with.

Article: The battle over potential mid-decade redistricting in Texas -- where the state's congressional district lines could be redrawn well ahead of the upcoming census -- continued Monday as dozens of Texas House Democrats remained out of state for a second week to block any potential votes on the map. In Austin, the Texas House of Representatives is scheduled to meet and the redistricting bill is technically scheduled for a second reading (which would not be a vote to pass it out of the chamber). The Texas Senate is also scheduled to meet and may vote on its own version of redistricting legislation, although if it votes the bill out of the Senate it cannot be voted on in the House until there is a quorum. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Abbott has also said he will call special legislative session after special session to get the Republican-supported maps passed, even if Democrats run out the 30-day clock on the current session. "If they want to evade that arrest, they're going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years, and they might as well just start voting in California or voting in Illinois, wherever they may be," he continued. speaks during a press conference held by Texas Democratic lawmakers after leaving the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw Texas' 38 congressional districts, in Aurora, Ill., Aug.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

Article: government will take 15% of the revenue that chipmaker Nvidia pulls in from sales in China of its H20 microchip, which is used in the development of artificial intelligence, President Trump said on Monday. At a news conference at the White House, Trump said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked for restrictions on exports to be eased so that Nvidia could sell H20s into the Chinese market. Trump called the H20 "obsolete," and "an old chip that China already has … in a different form, different name." Nvidia designed the H20 to be less powerful than the company's top-of-the-line microchips to comply with export controls. Trump suggested that Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which he called "super duper advanced," might also be in play, but in a diminished form — and that he'd want a 30-to-50% cut of those sales.

Article: California is asking Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. On Monday, Trump said he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city’s police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as the mayor has noted that crime is falling in the nation’s capital. WATCH: Trump says he’s placing Washington police under federal control and deploying National Guard In June, the Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. The Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. After their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. The Trump administration argued the troops were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel in Los Angeles, which has been a key location in the federal government’s aggressive immigration strategy. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him. The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that AMD, the second-place AI chip maker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

And even in the face of death, he persisted, because this is a story that must be told." Mohammed Qreieh, 33, was a father of two from Gaza City, the Associated Press news agency reported. Israel alleges Sharif led 'terrorist cell', with little evidence The Israeli military accused Sharif of posing as a journalist, saying he had "served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas" and was responsible for launching rocket attacks at Israelis - but it has produced little evidence to support these claims. In a statement, the IDF said it had documents which "unequivocally prove" his "military affiliation" with Hamas, including "personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents". It has publicly released some screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. He described this as a "longstanding pattern" and referred to the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.

Article: HELSINKI (AP) — Finnish authorities said Monday they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia. The Finnish deputy prosecutor general said in a statement that charges of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications were filed against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union’s executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers.

It added that the defendants “consider that Finland lacks jurisdiction in the case, as the locations of the cable damages are outside Finnish territorial waters.” The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of Estonia’s electricity needs in winter, did not disrupt service, although it drove up energy prices in the Baltic nations.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that’s more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu’s office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. READ MORE: Israel targets and kills Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif in Gaza airstrike as journalist toll grows Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: “There is no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.” Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: ET Campbell RobertsonKatie Rogers and President Trump significantly escalated his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital on Monday, saying that he was temporarily taking control of the city’s police department and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime there. At a White House news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington — including “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth” — that stood in sharp contrast to official figures showing violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days. Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of D.C., called them “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,” and said his office “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.” Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize. Familiar targets: In decrying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Article: The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will need to drastically cut rations to refugees in Kenya due to reductions in global aid, including major funding cuts from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Residents of the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps were beginning to feel the impact of food aid cuts on Monday as the WFP implemented a new assistance system there in which certain groups are prioritised over others. The WFP said aid is being cut by 60 percent for the most vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and disabled people, and by 80 percent for refugees with some kind of income. This will have a serious impact on vulnerable refugees, increasing the risk of hunger and malnutrition.” “There has been a lot of tension in the last couple of weeks or so,” Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi said, reporting from Kakuma. “People were very angry about what WFP is calling the priority food distribution, where some people will not get food at all and others are going to get a small fraction of the food.” These tensions boiled over, triggering protests last week, which left one person dead and several others injured, said Soi, adding that WFP officials she spoke with said the aid cuts from organisations like USAID meant they have had to make “very difficult decisions about who gets to eat and who doesn’t”. “We need to look at them separately and differently and see how best we can channel the system so that it provides.” The impact of these cuts is severe amid concerns over malnutrition. “Already the food that is being issued is quite low, 40 percent of the recommended ration, and this is being shared by a bigger chunk of the population,” Chica said, adding that stocks will therefore not last as long as hoped.

Article: US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the "obsolete" H20 chip to China. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it "a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security." Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue." Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia's chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Kennedy Jr., a leading anti-science voice and longtime opponent of vaccines, “shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.” Similarly, MSNBC reported that the violence has left officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency understandably shaken, and “many are now demanding answers” from Kennedy, who “has long vilified the CDC and contributed to a culture of misinformation that they say makes them targets.” (The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment.) Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University, summarized the deadly violence this way in an opinion piece for The New York Times: “The attack left both himself and a law enforcement officer dead, and C.D.C. union has asked federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, since it is putting lives at risk.” It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump, as of this writing, has not commented on the CDC shooting at all, despite the president maintaining an active publishing schedule on his social media platform in recent days. Jerome Adams told CBS’ Margaret Brennan on ‘Face the Nation.’ During his on-air appearance, Adams, who served with Trump during the president’s first term, characterized Kennedy’s response to the deadly shooting as “tepid,” and emphasized how long it took for RFK Jr. “It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings, and that’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams added. Instead, the beleaguered HHS secretary posted condolences “more than 30 minutes after posting photos of himself fishing on social media.” Time will tell whether the deadly shooting causes RFK Jr.

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so. His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a “humanitarian catastrophe.” Australia’s government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. Albanese says conditions must be met for Palestine recognition Albanese told reporters after a Cabinet meeting Monday that Australia’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. READ MORE: France will recognize Palestine as a state, President Macron says “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said. “The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.” Netanyahu rebuked Australia before the announcement Ahead of Albanese’s announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state. The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. “This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all,” Albanese said. A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state. In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government “will carefully weigh up its position” on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September. “This commitment removes any incentive or diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always stood in the way of ending the conflict,” spokesperson for the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said in a statement. He told reporters in Melbourne on Monday that the move would do nothing to end the “ongoing genocide in Gaza which has been live streamed for the entire world for two years.”

The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” READ MORE: South Korean investigators seek arrest of ex-President Yoon’s wife The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

Article: Congressman Abraham Hamadeh made a brief visit to Syria where he discussed with the country’s interim president the return of the body of an American aid worker who was taken hostage and later confirmed dead in the war-torn country, his office said Monday. Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority. The militant group lost most of its territory in Iraq in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019 when it lost the last sliver of land it controlled in east Syria.

Article: Drivers warned about scam car finance payout calls But the judgement left the possibility open for other motorists to claim, including those who had been charged overly large commission fees. The warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) comes after the watchdog announced it would set up a compensation scheme for motorists who were sold car finance deals that were unlawful. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the FCA announced it would start consulting on setting up a compensation scheme for eligible motorists, and it expects most eligible people to get less than £950. "We're aware of scammers calling people and posing as car finance lenders, offering fake compensation and asking for personal details," said Nisha Arora, director of special projects at the FCA. If anyone receives a call like this, hang up immediately and do not share any information." The FCA said it would never ask people for bank account PINs or passwords, and it has urged people to report any scam calls or texts to Ofcom. In a joint statement with the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the FCA pointed out that motorists could sacrifice up to 30% of any claims award in fees to the CMC or law firm. The point of a centralised redress scheme would be to make it easy for consumers to get compensation, without the need for help from a CMC or law firm, the FCA said. The final bill for the redress scheme could be as much as £18bn, with the watchdog estimating millions of people who bought new or used cars potentially dating back as far as 2007 could be eligible to make claims.

Article: They have got one of, if not the best, midfields in the country, they are really strong in wide areas and it looks like they are signing another centre-half in AC Milan's Malick Thiaw. They have seen Trent Alexander-Arnold leave, and tragically lost Diogo Jota, but have spent heavily to strengthen their squad and won't be distracted by having any stars coming to the end of their contract. How Gyokeres fits in is one of the things I am really looking forward to finding out in the new campaign, and it is the same with other strikers at new clubs, like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro at Chelsea. I was disappointed that he chose to go there over Newcastle, but at the same time I saw him live several times last season and he is a player with potential, rather than offering guaranteed goals. With Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United have spent more than £200m on their forward line, but I still don't see them getting in next season's top four.

Article: A group of Democratic lawmakers is pressing Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink for details on the Trump administration’s plan to pull funds from an Air Force nuclear modernization program to retrofit a luxury jet the president was given by the Qatari government. Jamie Raskin (Maryland) and John Garamendi (California) want answers on the plan to pay for this presidential vanity project with up to $934 million from the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program, which is meant to upgrade the military’s nuclear arsenal. But rather than slash the program (like, say, funding for cutting-edge mRNA research and other things the administration has deemed wasteful), the administration plans to pull $400 million from it to retrofit Trump’s palatial new airplane, Meink said last month at a Senate subcommittee hearing. As one might imagine, the aforementioned Democrats are raising issues in a letter addressed to Meink last Wednesday: We write with concerns about how the Air Force is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to President Trump that likely violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Deb Fischer of Nebraska have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the executive branch’s pet projects, the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting president, who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description: Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the Sentinel program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the Qatari luxury jet to serve as Air Force One — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the Trump library’s private plane. They go on: It appears that funds for programs that the Air Force has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for presidential whims, while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers. On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund joined the pressure campaign, urging the Defense Department’s inspector general to open a probe into whether the administration has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically given to the Department of Defense).

Article: And in fact, he segued in his second term from being strictly confrontational with the Soviet Union, as he was in his first term, to actually forging a friendship with Gorbachev and reducing tensions and setting the stage for the end of the Cold War. BOOT: Well, I think, you know, the prime mover in many ways were, of course, the people of Eastern Europe, the people of Eastern Germany who didn't want to live under a communist dictatorship. And I think Gorbachev also deserves a lot of credit because he did not react in the way that the rulers of China did during the Tiananmen Square protests that same year. So this is a very complicated strategic calculus that the president has to deal with, and I'm not sure that President Trump is aware enough of the nuances or the consequences of his actions. INSKEEP: For that very reason, I wonder which of the president's actions we can see as changing the world and which we can see as getting attention, so to speak. And clearly, in the years since, he has become the preeminent figure in the Republican Party and taken the Republican Party in many ways in very different directions from those espoused by President Reagan. INSKEEP: In the current president's constant changes of attitude and position toward other world leaders, toward various wars and other situations, do you see any possibility of something like you described with Reagan where he confronted the Soviet Union and then got to another phase, and things got better? And so remember during his first term where he went from threatening to rain fire and fury on North Korea to talking about how much he loved Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. But right now, it's very hard to figure out what his method is actually gaining us because, you know, all that zigzagging is, I think, very confusing not just to Americans, but also to other world leaders.

Article: The president’s move also spurred Democratic governors, including Newsom, to pledge retaliatory redistricting efforts in their states — setting up the possibility of an extended standoff that could upend the 2026 midterm elections. Lawler calls for redistricting battles to end Newsom urged Trump in a letter Monday to abandon his scheme, telling the president he is “playing with fire” and “risking the destabilization of our democracy.” Newsom said he prefers that independent bodies draw political districts rather than partisan legislatures, as is done in Texas and most GOP-controlled states. But, he wrote, “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” If Texas and “the other states call off their redistricting efforts,” the governor added, “we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.” Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying in Illinois, New York and elsewhere, and they say they have no intentions of returning as long as Republicans are intent on mollifying Trump. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,” Abbott said over the weekend on “Fox News Sunday.” At the least, Texas lawmakers face $500 daily fines for each absence under legislative rules. She compared both the proposed Texas maps, which would disproportionately affect districts represented by Black and Latino Democrats, and Abbott’s and Paxton’s threats to the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. “Their fight is our fight, and just like the Civil Rights heroes of the past, no matter the cost we are prepared to see it through to the end,” Bowers said.

Article: The U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is happening at a site where East meets West — quite literally — in a place familiar to both countries as a Cold War front line of missile defense, radar outposts and intelligence gathering. But the Kremlin has long pushed back against Putin meeting Zelenskyy -– at least until a peace deal is reached by Russia and Ukraine and was ready to be signed. Putin said last week he wasn’t against meeting Zelenskyy “but certain conditions need to be created” for it to happen and were “still a long way off.” That raised fears about excluding Ukraine from negotiations. READ MORE: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in Russia as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit After the USSR’s collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don’t play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.” Sam Greene of King’s College London said on X the symbolism of Alaska as the site of a summit about Ukraine was “horrendous — as though designed to demonstrate that borders can change, land can be bought and sold.” What’s the agenda? Moscow presented ceasefire conditions that are nonstarters for Zelenskyy, such as withdrawing troops from the four regions Russia illegally annexed in 2022, halting mobilization efforts, or freezing Western arms deliveries. For a broader peace, Putin demands Kyiv cede the annexed regions, even though Russia doesn’t fully control them, and Crimea, renounce a bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language along with Ukrainian. Putin has warned Ukraine it will face tougher conditions for peace as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for territory still under Ukrainian control in the four annexed regions annexed by Moscow. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to cement Russia’s territorial gains, keep Ukraine out of NATO and prevent it from hosting any Western troops so Moscow can gradually pull the country back into its orbit. He believes time is on his side as Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances along the front line amid swarms of Moscow’s missiles and drones battering the country. “A sustainable peace also means that aggression cannot be rewarded.” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday he believed Trump was “making sure that Putin is serious, and if he is not, then it will stop there.” “If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue. Since last week, Putin spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as well as the leaders of South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, the Kremlin said.

Article: As President Trump announced on Monday he was deploying National Guard troops to fight crime in the nation’s capital, lawyers with his Justice Department were preparing to defend his use of the Guard in Los Angeles. The deployment was fraught with problems and lawsuits from the start, and a three-day trial began Monday in San Francisco federal court for a suit by state officials to end the activation. Testifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agents.

Article: What to know about DC Home Rule Act as Trump puts DC police under federal control President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Section 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president the ability to use D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department for "federal purposes" that the president "may deem necessary and appropriate." On Monday, Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of D.C.'s police force. On Capitol Hill, many Democrats have said the moves are a power grab by the president and a distraction from other matters, such as Trump's involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein files. Chris Murphy said in a post on X that "Trump's decision to take over the DC police isn't about public safety" and is "another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent." In a post on X, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith wrote, "WHAT THE HECK IS IN THOSE FILES?!" -- a reference to the Epstein files -- accompanied by a video of Trump in the briefing room for his announcement.

Article: “In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.” The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday. The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said. Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel plans to widen its coming offensive beyond Gaza City to the last areas not yet under Israeli control, and where most of Gaza’s 2 million residents have sought shelter as the territory slides toward famine. The mobilization of forces is expected to take weeks, and Israel may be using the threat of a wider offensive to try to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages or surrendering after 22 months of war sparked by its Oct. Any expansion of Israeli operations is likely to bring even more death and destruction to the war-ravaged territory, around 75% of which is already largely destroyed and controlled by Israel. Netanyahu says Israel will go into the central camps Israel announced last week its plans to take over Gaza City, where it has already carried out major raids and heavy bombardment throughout the war. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss aspects of the plans that have not been made public, said the operation will not begin immediately and will take a significant amount of time to scale up. Few places left to flee Netanyahu said Israel will allow civilians to flee to “designated safe zones,” where “they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.” He did not say where they would go. Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly floated the idea of transferring Gaza’s population to a so-called “humanitarian city” that the military would build on the ruins of the southernmost city of Rafah — now a largely uninhabited Israeli military zone — on the border with Egypt. READ MORE: Israel targets and kills Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif in Gaza airstrike as journalist toll grows A possible negotiating tactic Netanyahu has said he will end the war if Hamas gives up power, lays down its arms and releases the remaining 50 hostages — around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group says it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not give up its weapons as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. But the hostages are Hamas’ only remaining bargaining chip, and it is unlikely to give them up if it believes that Israel will then resume the war, attempt to eradicate the group and carry out plans to depopulate Gaza.

Article: Compared to recent weeks, earnings won't be as much of a catalyst for the markets with only a small handful of stocks in the S & P 500 scheduled to report. Nvidia deal : The market doesn't mind that Club name Nvidia and peer AMD will have to give the United States a 15% share of all AI chip sales to China. The arrangement, confirmed by President Donald Trump on Monday, is part of a broader deal announced last month that restored the companies' ability to sell AI chips to Chinese customers. That ability had been revoked in April, when the Trump administration tightened Biden-era export controls that had forced Nvidia and AMD to design throttled-back versions of their top-end AI chips for the Chinese market. The bigger prize is maintaining the ability to sell to China, a market that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated could be worth $50 billion in the next few years. "From Nvidia's standpoint and from AMD's standpoint, I get it, like 85 cents is better than anything, and it's important for them to be able to sell into China because otherwise you're just handing that market over to China and to the local players. We need to be able to compete there, so that's good," Rasgon said on "The Exchange." He added, "I think that should happen on their own merits." To size up the potential impact of this payment, Nvidia was selling about $8 billion worth of chips to China a quarter prior to the previous export restriction. That's a large number for most companies, but not for Nvidia: analysts estimate the company will do about $200 billion in revenue over its ongoing fiscal year 2026 and $255 billion in fiscal year 2027.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multi-year war between Ukraine and Russia. Trump said he’s going to see what Putin “has in mind” to end the war and, if it’s a “fair deal,” he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting. Asked on Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to Alaska, Trump said the Ukrainian leader “wasn’t a part of it” and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as “really a feel-out,” would be to Zelenskyy “out of respect.” He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy "‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say, ‘we can make a deal.’" The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city’s police force. During his remarks, the president noted how even following “a great call” with Putin in the past, “missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you’d have 60 people laying on a road dying,” a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal. “Now, I will say this, ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” the president added. He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the “best deal that could be made for both parties.” But “there’ll be some swapping, there’ll be some changes in land,” Trump said, returning to the idea of so-called “land swaps,” which he said on Friday would be “to the betterment of both.” Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. “Next Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.

Article: The head of public policy and municipal strategy at Hilltop Securities has been warning investors that a " window of opportunity " may close fast once the idea that the Federal Reserve is destined to cut interest rates gains in popularity. Plus, recent economic data, Traders now see a about an 86% chance of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, according to the CME FedWatch tool , which uses 30-Day fed funds futures prices to determine the odds. The average municipal bond yielded 3.9% late last week, down from 4% the week before, helped by a rally in the Treasury market, said Cooper Howard, fixed-income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research. "So on the one hand, that means that the opportunity for municipal-to-Treasury ratios being very attractive could continue for a couple of days — but I'm saying days, I'm not saying weeks," Kozlik said. "So this is something that when individual investors see this, they can't wait." Where to find opportunity Kozlik largely recommends high-grade, well-rated state and local general obligation bonds and revenue-authority bonds.

Article: Even as the 47th president, he still regularly launches late-night, ALL-CAPS social media rants about other countries “LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.” But it’s his fear and loathing of China “laughing” at the United States that he’s made into a firm pillar of his political movement. They will regularly fulminate about China dominating the world and accuse every American leader other than Trump of surrendering our country’s greatness to the “globalists” and “communists.” And yet, less than seven months into Trump’s second term, China is sitting pretty when it comes to its economic, military and diplomatic clout around the world. A country with a huge market that was acting as a bulwark against Chinese economic domination of Asia seems like the kind of ally a president obsessed with China’s ascendance would want. Following Trump’s gutting of Voice of America, China expanded its media operations in Asia and Africa, where the citizenry can get a healthy dose of subtle pro-China propaganda with no pro-America counterpart. In a report released in July, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote, “In private, our allies tell us that Chinese officials are gleeful, characterizing the United States as unreliable. But in many cases, Beijing is doubling down on its own long-term investments — in overseas infrastructure, critical minerals exploitation and exchange programs that bring foreign talent to Chinese universities — all while America withdraws.” It also appears that many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot who is advancing China’s interests at the expense of America’s. Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton wrote in The Hill that some examples of “Trump’s softness” on China “include allowing Nvidia to resume exports of sensitive information technology to China and ignoring legal requirements to ban TikTok or force it to divest its Chinese ownership.” Many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot. Trump has also taken pains to not displease Chinese leader Xi Jinping over Taiwan — which the CCP views as an illegitimate breakaway state that it intends to bring under its yoke someday. The Trump administration last month told Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te to avoid a stopover in New York, according to reporting in The New York Times, which also quoted former Trump administration deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger as saying the U.S. “bent over backwards” to avoid offending China and that “Beijing will pocket this concession and ask for more.” Nicholas Grossman wrote in these pages in April, “If the eventual result is China’s rising to become the world’s predominant power, historians will note that it didn’t take global leadership, America threw it away.” But we don’t have to wait for historians’ take on Trump inexplicably ceding many of America’s long-held advantages on the global stage to China.

Article: Five more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing blockade of Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, the Health Ministry has said, as people in the enclave and many beyond its besieged borders mourned several journalists assassinated by Israel. The ministry on Monday said most of these victims died in the past three weeks, as Israel-imposed starvation engulfs the entire population, with the total number of severe hunger deaths now at 222, including 101 children. It’s time for statements to turn into action and for an immediate ceasefire.” At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raids across Gaza since dawn on Monday, including six aid seekers, medical sources have told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, on a daily basis, Israeli forces and US contractors are continuing to kill Palestinians desperately seeking aid at distribution points run by the controversial United States and Israeli-backed GHF. An outpouring of grief and condemnation followed the Israeli assassination of five Al Jazeera Arabic staff in Gaza, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, in a drone attack late on Sunday that hit a tent for journalists positioned outside the main gate of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital. The attack came days after the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, warned of “unfounded accusations by the Israeli army” against al-Sharif after Israel repeatedly and falsely accused the 28-year-old reporter of being a Hamas affiliate. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors: first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming seizure of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Advertisement Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum, who reports for the network’s English channel, said the journalists were “working around the clock to unearth facts on the ground and keep the world informed about what has been going on in Gaza”. Speaking of his colleagues al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, Abu Azzoum said their deliberate killings were being seen in Gaza “as an attempt to silence two of the most courageous voices”.

Article: An explosion at a steel plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States has left one dead and dozens injured or trapped, with emergency workers on site trying to rescue victims, officials said. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it’s like something bad happened.” Dozens were injured and the county was sending 15 ambulances, in addition to the ambulances supplied by local emergency response agencies, Reigner said. Air quality concerns and health warnings The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major US Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers. The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosion and advised residents within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. In another lawsuit, residents said that following a massive 2018 fire, the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs, and was hard to breathe due to the release of sulfur dioxide. Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5m in equipment upgrades and $5m on local clean air efforts and programmes as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by the Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has previously sued US Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” In June, US Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalised a “historic partnership”, a deal that gives the US government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15bn buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after US Steel shareholders approved it.

This is why he formally declared a public safety emergency in the city in a pair of executive orders that placed the Metropolitan Police Department under the federal government control and directed 800 National Guard members into the streets. Trump went even further, seemingly soft-launching the case for potential federal intervention in more Democrat-led cities — Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland — “if they don’t learn their lesson” to address crime. In June, he sent nearly 5,000 troops to Los Angeles — mostly National Guard but also, much more unusually, several hundred Marines — after protests broke out over his immigration policies, blurring the line between the U.S.

Article: Doubt over the accuracy and integrity of the data is a serious issue considering how much BLS work is used to formulate policy, calculate Social Security payments and inform any number of other political and economic decisions. "I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time," DoubleLine CEO Jeffery Gundlach said last week on CNBC. data has never been perfect, but has been of high quality, compiled impartially, and useful in the setting of policy." Questions on multiple fronts Gapen's sentiments mirror those around Wall Street, where written commentary has broken down the various issues the BLS has already faced in terms of budget cuts that have pushed it to alter the way it is collecting some data. Also, notable revisions the BLS has applied to its critical monthly payrolls count have raised concerns, including accusations from Trump that the McEntarfer-led BLS was manipulating the data for political purposes. "We argue the data remain reliable, though we would recommend being careful with the initial jobs data." Looking for inflation clues On the market's plate this week, though, are the two key inflation readings, first with the consumer price index on Tuesday, then the producer price measure, considered a gauge of costs at the wholesale level, on Thursday. At issue for the BLS is its move to stop collecting CPI data from several cities due to staffing limitations, as well as the growing use of imputed data, or estimating price movements in areas where it can't get exact information. In those cases, the BLS will try to use data from another source, preferably somewhere near to the locale it is surveying, but sometimes it has to use prices from other urban areas as assumptions. Bank of America estimates that a combination of different-cell imputation and the varied impact of tariffs likely will alter the headline CPI reading by only a basis point or two — 0.01 or 0.02 percentage point. "Still we do not think the BLS' decision to reduce the CPI sample is enough to warrant alarm over the signal from the inflation data." Impact on Fed moves Indeed, precision will matter as the Federal Reserve closely monitors inflation data and charts its monetary policy course. Excluding food and energy, the respective forecasts for core inflation are 0.3% for the month and 3.1% for the year, the latter up 0.2 percentage point from a month ago. "Sequential firming in inflation is one key factor behind our view that the Fed will remain on hold at the September meeting despite recent employment data that point to a sharp slowdown in labor demand," Morgan Stanley's Gapen wrote. Traders widely expect the central bank to cut the fed funds in September, then at least once more before the end of the year, but Wall Street economists are in multiple camps. "Taken at face value, the new procedures implemented by the BLS should not introduce systematic bias into its estimates of CPI inflation, but it will increase volatility in future CPI prints," Gapen wrote.

Cooprider said he “would like to get rid of it,” the texts show, saying the two were “not in love” or together and that it would be “messed up to bring a child into the world without both parents raising them.” When Cooprider reiterated his desire for Davis to “get rid of it” after her pregnancy test came back positive days later, she asked him to use a different phrase. “I literally feel like I’m going down the steepest hill on a roller coaster when I read that.” The following text messages allegedly show Cooprider telling Davis, without her approval, that he would order abortion pills online.

Article: The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.” Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Article: Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown 44 minutes ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Share Save Watch: Trump announces deployment of National Guard to Washington DC President Donald Trump said he was deploying the National Guard to Washington DC and taking control of the city's police force as he pledged to crack down on crime and homelessness in the city. "I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse," Trump said during a news conference in which he was flanked by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will lead the city's police force while it is under federal control. Mayor Bowser, a Democrat, acknowledged there had been a "terrible" spike in crime in 2023, which mirrored a national trend, but she pushed back against any claims of a crimewave in the city. "The president is very aware of our efforts." When asked about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's comment that Washington is more violent than Baghdad, Bowser said "any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false". That act was instituted by former President Richard Nixon to allow residents of Washington DC - which is the only US city that is not in any of the 50 states - to elect a city council and a mayor. On Sunday, when asked about the possibility of the president taking control of the city's police department, Mayor Bowser said: "There are very specific things in our law that would allow [that]. "We have seen a huge decrease in crime because of those efforts." Watch: DC Mayor Bowser says crime in the city is at a 30-year low As well as crime, Trump also spoke at length about homelessness in Washington DC. "If our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty and they don't respect us." Local groups working with homeless people in the capital told the BBC they had actually seen progress in recent years. Homelessness is down almost 20% for individuals in Washington DC in 2025 compared to five years ago, said Ralph Boyd, the president and chief executive of So Others Might Eat (SOME) - a group that provides people in the city with housing, clothing and other social services.

Article: As this shift to cloud computing took hold, Melius noted that these companies all saw a steep contraction in their price-to-earnings multiples, a classic sign that investors believe slower growth is ahead. The cloud was a priority for CEO Satya Nadella upon taking over in early 2014, and it's paid off handsomely for investors — just take a look at the stock chart versus the S & P 500. Microsoft would have no doubt been on that list of on-premise fallen angels — even if not a hardware play like Hewlett-Packard and Dell — had they not jumped on cloud computing and instead kept their fate tied to the on-premise hardware providers. Instead of companies paying for a perpetual license to use a specific version of software, SaaS companies sold their product on a subscription basis, bringing in a more predictable recurring revenue stream that investors were willing to assign a higher multiple. They added, "We think there will be FOMO across all industries to cut costs and get their stocks up - SaaS is the casualty as AI adoption accelerates." To be sure, while this is a potential concern for Salesforce, plenty of other tech names in the portfolio stand to benefit. Indeed, the Melius analysts themselves contend: "While SaaS should be avoided, 'Software' companies with clouds [such as Microsoft and Oracle] are continuing to see acceleration in demand." "Another area fueling demand is the acceleration of AI agents that do the work of SaaS and fuel demand for more compute," Melius added. Agentic AI is a type of AI system that can complete certain tasks without human intervention, and it's become a big area of investment and focus in the AI race — including for Salesforce. And given that SaaS is generally based on the seat-based licensing model, if Salesforce's customers have fewer employees because their remaining ones are using AI to be more productive, that translates to less demand for software seats — all else being equal. Instead, the company is working to build out its agentic AI offering, appropriately dubbed Agentforce, so that it can help clients move more quickly into the AI era, while also building out a new AI-oriented revenue stream that can hopefully help extract more revenue from those seats at customers that do remain. Unlike Adobe, it's also important to keep in mind that Salesforce is targeted almost exclusively toward enterprise, where the customer cohort tends to be more sticky and a bit slower to change things up, lest they risk a misstep that hurts sales. While Salesforce isn't alone in offering tools to build Agents — Microsoft, which competes with Salesforce in the CRM arena, also has them — the company clearly has a strategy. As a result, we're downgrading shares of Salesforce to a hold-equivalent 2 rating as we look to better understand to what extent Salesforce is being disrupted, or if can indeed adapt to the new world.

Article: A man believed to have been a part of a Romanian criminal organization was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week after he stole tens of thousands of welfare cards across California and New York. When he was arrested at a New York City Airbnb apartment in June 2024, he had over $37,000 in cash and nearly 1,500 stolen account access numbers in his possession, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. He worked with multiple people internationally in the scheme, with one accomplice receiving more than 36,000 stolen EBT card numbers from Graur over the course of three years, the statement said. Advertisement In 2023, The Times reported on a string of Romanian citizens who had been arrested for skimming EBT funds through ATMs, including Virgil Negru, a member of the Eforie City Council, who was charged with felony forgery and identity theft. But that changed in California in April, when the state rolled out new cards with microchips, said Gerry Bonilla, the division chief for program compliance in the state’s Social Services Department.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israel’s military targeted an Al Jazeera correspondent with an airstrike Sunday, killing him, another network journalist and at least six other people, all of whom were sheltering outside Gaza City's largest hospital complex. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif's death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that it was appalled by the strike. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group's regional director, said in a statement.

Article: “At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” Trump said at a White House press conference that he called to announce plans for a federal takeover of Washington’s police force to help combat crime. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he expected to determine mere moments into his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week whether it would be possible to work out a deal to halt the war in Ukraine. He said he thought Friday’s sitdown with Putin in Alaska would be “really a feel-out meeting.” Trump added that “it’ll be good, but it might be bad” and predicted he may say, “lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.” READ MORE: What to know about the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska Putin wants to lock in Russia’s gains since invading Ukraine in February 2022 as Trump presses for a ceasefire that has remained out of reach. The Trump-Putin meeting so far isn’t going to include Zelenskyy Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, “The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin” but it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow. To that point, Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to “tell them what kind of a deal — I’m not going to make a deal. It’s not up to me to make a deal.” Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Trump’s up and down relations with Putin More recently, Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn’t appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn’t done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday’s meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow’s sphere of influence. Europeans will prepare with a virtual meeting on Ukraine this week With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday. The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and “related issues of territorial claims and security.” Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles (418 kilometers) east of Moscow. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Article: Barcelona’s domination of Real Madrid last season resulted in Los Blancos bringing an end to Carlo Ancelotti’s second tenure – even though he had delivered a league and European double a year previous. Rumours rumbled for most of the season, after a low-key start at home and abroad, that former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso would be making the switch from Bayer Leverkusen to replace Ancelotti. With their La Liga and UEFA Champions League defence over, the Madrid-based club wasted little time in announcing Alonso, conveniently at a time when Brazil cranked up their interest in Ancelotti. The first match of the new Spanish campaign is on Friday, August 15 and sees Girona, who finished only a point above the relegation zone last season, entertain a Rayo Vallecano side that claimed ninth spot in La Liga last year. It has been a quiet transfer window for Barcelona, whose finances had been heavily in the spotlight last year with La Liga rules limiting spending on wages and transfers – complicating the registration of Dani Olmo. The Spanish international arrived from RB Leipzig in Germany for a fee of $62.5m in the summer of 2024, but was nearly forced into a free transfer away from the Catalan club due to their dire financial situation. The loan of Marcus Rashford, who made his debut in the 5-0 pre-season demolition of Como, from Manchester United is Barca’s only major addition in the off season to their ranks so far. A 4-0 demolition of Real in Madrid on October 26 kicked off the derbies last season, the first major warning signs that Los Blancos may have a turbulent ride ahead. That defeat for Ancelotti’s side was compounded by a 5-2 hammering in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, before a 3-2 Copa Del Rey final win for Barca in late April left Real facing up to the prospect of a trophyless season. The lack of any major additions to Barcelona’s title-winning squad will throw doubt on whether manager Hansi Flick will be able to push the players to go again without further competition for places. Flick’s side will be fully expected to put up a stern defence of their La Liga title and to go all the way in the Champions League, a competition they were heavily favourites to win last season until their shock semifinal elimination by Inter Milan. Real Madrid will have to cope with the loss of Luka Modric in midfield, only a year after the retirement of Toni Kroos – an absence believed to have heavily contributed to Real’s demise last season. Nonetheless, the link-up between an attack and midfield, which is now missing both of its mainstays for more than a decade, will be the major problem for Alonso to solve. Alongside fellow countryman Julian Alvarez, France and Atletico legend Antoine Griezmann, and Giuliano Simeone, the son of the manager, Almada could well sprinkle the magic needed to elevate Atletico to the top of the pile.

Article: Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County? The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 — on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas. (Aung Shine Oo / Associated Press) Advertisement “It came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,” said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech. Geological Survey) Advertisement The magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine’s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. “It’s not going to come soon, because it’s quite a heavy calculation.” Still, such simulations would provide a model of “all possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.” Rescuers work at the site of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, that collapsed after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake centered in Myanmar on March 28. Or it could be a much larger earthquake — rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. By comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake’s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley — related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7. But while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike. “It is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.” A Buddhist monk walks near a collapsed pagoda on March 30 after an earthquake in central Myanmar. stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.” “And then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,” Avouac said. The entire length of the Sagaing fault — including areas that didn’t rupture in the March earthquake — is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate. These maps show the 317 miles of the Sagaing fault that ruptured in March, compared to the historical ruptures, as outlined in a 2016 study, of the San Andreas fault in California in 1730, 1812, 1857 and 1906. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956. “There’s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.” Advertisement There is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a “Big One” simply won’t ever strike California again. “If there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won’t hold forever.” Further research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said. The other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.

Article: (AP) — The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. “Some water did come in, it’s stinky water, we think it’s sewage, but we’ll be OK.” The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon’s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he’s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said.

Article: As punishment for flouting her order and being found in civil contempt, the judge required Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to file bimonthly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions have been made under the law. In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report. In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law. “ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

Article: The Israeli military last year accused six Al Jazeera journalists — including Anas al-Sharif whom Israel said it had targeted in its attack on Gaza City on Sunday — of being fighters with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. Al Jazeera denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence.” The Israeli military in 2024 killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza, claiming he was a member of Hamas’s military wing, along with a cameraman, Rami al-Rifee, who was not accused of involvement with the militant group. Al Jazeera called the accusation “baseless.” Israel has banned all foreign journalists from independently entering Gaza to cover the war since the conflict was ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. As a result, Al Jazeera’s Palestinian correspondents in Gaza have provided much of the on-the-ground coverage of the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and led to mass privation and hunger in the enclave.

While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, reaching prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling global trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower tariffs at a meeting between negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland. The relationship is very good with [China’s] President Xi [Jinping] and myself.” “We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian in a statement. Even as both countries appeared to be seeking to push back the reinstatement of duties, US trade envoy Jamieson Greer said last month that Trump will have the “final call” on any such extension. Ongoing negotiations Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump’s first term and now with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said she expected Trump to extend the 90-day “tariff detente” for another 90 days later on Monday. “The whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations, and there’s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,” she said.

Article: Trump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”. ‘Represent ourselves’ The rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia. Advertisement The city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.” In March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.” For many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community. Amari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. For his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”. Among those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.” “There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said. While DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data. Groups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”. Twenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”. Tanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred. ‘Best place for us to resist’ Maurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime. “When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.” “It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”

Article: At the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky this morning, Ford executives announced that they plan to retool the factory so they can roll out a midsize pickup truck in the $30,000 range within 18 months. This has long been the goal for a number of automakers: a truly affordable EV — one that competes with gas cars when it comes to the upfront sticker price, without factoring in government subsidies or the savings from gasoline. And they fizzled out." But after canceling its large electric SUV and just recently delaying a next-generation of electric full-size trucks and vans, Ford held this splashy event in Louisville to make it clear it was moving forward — really — with this project. Political headwinds, global realities Technically, what Ford announced is not just a single vehicle but a vehicle platform, which will eventually be adapted into a variety of vehicles that are all built the same way. The Kentucky plant, which currently makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will close for renovations and retooling, and reopen with 2,200 jobs, 600 fewer people than it employs now. Demand for battery-powered cars has come in lower than carmakers' expectations, and with federal tax credits expiring at the end of September , that trend is expected to slow even more. In a nod to those past challenges, Ford executives repeatedly said the new vehicle had to be "sustainable" — a reference not to the environmental benefits of EVs, but to the need for the car to be sustainable as a business proposition. And, at risk of understatement, companies don't always make their initial price targets; the F-150 Lightning and the Cybertruck were both first promised to start at $40,000, a price they never actually hit. Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research at the automotive insights firm Telemetry, said that while there's no guarantee that Ford can pull this off, the new price target is "plausible." "Most of what we know so far about what Ford is doing is not actually entirely new" for the EV industry, he said. Ford plans on reducing costs and complexity by using a small number of very large die-cast metal pieces for a truck's body, instead of a large number of small pieces; that's an innovation Tesla pioneered. And while he made promises about high-tech features and the future, executives also told workers in the plant they could look forward to a more mundane benefit from the $2 billion investment: When the plant reopens next year, Ford VP Bryce Currie told the assembled workers, it would have tempered air — and a much cooler temperature.

Article: “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” President Trump claimed on Monday, despite falling crime in Washington. President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling. Trump took the lectern in the White House briefing room and said he also intended to clear out the capital’s homeless population, without saying how officials would do it, or detailing where those people would go. From January 1 through August 10 each year 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 ’21 ’23 ’25 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 Instead, Mr. Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience and repeatedly detailed his coming trip to “Russia” — he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. “Why has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?” Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.” Reporting was contributed by Darren Sands , Sonia A.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. crackdown Analysis by Jonathan Allen Donald Trump isn’t the first president to deploy troops and federal agents in the name of safeguarding the nation’s capital, but he has been particularly selective about what represents a threat to the peace. In the summer of 2020, Trump amassed a heavily armed force in Lafayette Square, steps from the White House, and unleashed it on peaceful protesters demonstrating against unprovoked police violence. In appointing himself Washington’s top cop, he promised to clean up a city that he described as having been “overtaken” by “bloodthirsty criminals.” Attorney General Pam Bondi went a step further, vowing that “crime in D.C. That should make it easier for Trump to keep this promise — he can just take credit for what was already in motion — than the ones that have fallen short: ending inflation and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, among others. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was overrun by drug lords — the mayor at the time was arrested after he was caught smoking crack cocaine — and it was known as the murder capital of the world. In the meantime, he has portrayed himself again as a proponent of “law and order” — so long as it serves his political ends — which could allow him to position himself to take credit for a relatively safe and prosperous city, and leave Democrats to fight over how much crime-fighting is too much. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images To better understand how two candidates as ideologically opposed as President Donald Trump and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani could rise to prominence, just ask Ray. (Ray declined to share his last name out of concern that he could face backlash for his political views.) I first spoke with Ray in January when we reached out to some of the swing voters who propelled Trump to victory last year. “But he makes the effort to go out and talk to people and reach out to people and try to actually do things that are better for the working class.” The son of Asian immigrants, Ray has not always been tuned into politics. He registered as a Democrat to have a say in the deep blue city’s politics and because the party supported policies he benefitted from as a kid, like public education, school lunches and afterschool programs. “When I was voting for Biden, it was the expectation that things will go back to normal,” Ray said, later adding, “The problem is we never really got the normalcy.” So he cast his ballot for Trump in 2024, the first time he had ever supported a Republican. “It’s not about Republicans or Democrats in my mind,” Ray said, adding that he is drawn to a candidate “who is honest, who’s authentic, and someone who has the benefits of the little person in the back of their mind.” “I think having that’s important, and I think that’s what’s missing in the politics these days,” he said. 🗞️ Today's other top stories 🌏 Russia-Ukraine latest: Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the war.

Article: DALLAS — North Texas' ongoing population boom means more hospitals and medical facilities are needed to meet the region's healthcare needs -- particularly as rural hospitals around the state and beyond struggle financially. John Henderson of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals recently warned that a third of the 157 rural hospitals in Texas have less than 10 days' cash on hand. "In some of the rural areas, the hospitals are struggling from a financial point of view, a cash-flow point of view and, as a result, they may have to cut back services, which creates a gap, or they may even have to close units," DFW Hospital Council CEO Steve Love said. "Some of the rural hospitals in Texas, unfortunately, have closed labor and delivery because of not having enough physicians, and not having the staff." To help fill gaps in healthcare access and accommodate steep growth in the population centers of North Texas, a number of new medical facilities have either recently opened or are in the works across the northern sectors of the Metroplex. Aside from building new hospitals, Love said he expects North Texas will also see more outpatient clinics and "probably as much focus as possible on telemedicine," as the population continues to grow. So here’s a look at the different facilities major health systems have recently opened or are coming soon to North Texas -- and how the entities behind these new facilities are deciding where to put them. Map of hospitals and facilities recently opened or in the works in North Texas Baylor Scott & White Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest nonprofit health system in Texas, officially opened Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Frisco at PGA Parkway, a new 340,000-square-foot, 84-bed hospital, earlier this summer. "Baylor Scott & White is committed to expanding access to high-quality care built on a legacy of clinical excellence," said Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Frisco at PGA Parkway President Ryan Gebhart when asked when the facility brings to the table. "As North Texas continues to grow, this new medical center is poised to meet the needs of a thriving region." Baylor Scott & White – Frisco at PGA Parkway Chief Medical Officer Eric Beshires said the new facility was designed to continue to meet the needs of North Texas into the future. "As we enter our third decade of Baylor Scott & White's service within the City of Frisco, we are committed to continuing to grow with the community to meet the changing needs of this area." Medical City Medical City Healthcare has expansion projects in the works across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a particular focus on fast-growing Collin County and Fort Worth, the 11th largest city in the country. "As the North Texas region continues to grow and evolve, Medical City Healthcare is strategically expanding to ensure families have access to the essential services they need, including emergency care, mental healthcare, hospital services, and specialized programs," Medical City spokesperson Janet St. "Expansion is focused on underserved communities or areas experiencing rapid population growth, where we can make the greatest impact on community health and provide timely, expert and compassionate care close to home." In the last five years, Medical City says the health system has invested more than $1.7 billion in everything from building acquisitions and expansion to facility enhancements and technology. Medical City Mental Health & Wellness Center Alliance – a 65,000-square-foot, single-story hospital providing inpatient and outpatient services at 3100 Alliance Town Center in Fort Worth – opened in February to provide access to inpatient mental healthcare in the area. That same year, Medical City bought Medical City Mental Health and Wellness Center Frisco at 5680 Frisco Square Boulevard, and Medical City Sachse, a campus of Medical City Plano at 4750 President George Bush Highway that provides 24/7 emergency care. In 2023 Medical City acquired Medical City Decatur, a campus of Medical Center Denton at 609 Medical Center Drive, which is a full-service, acute care hospital with 150 beds, with the goal of "maintaining vital hospital access in a more rural community." This year, work is underway on a new, three-story patient tower at Medical City Arlington that will add 60 more patient care beds, bringing the total thee to 496. The space will house a 28-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit, specially-equipped ICU beds for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (an advanced life support therapy for patients whose heart or lungs are not functioning properly) and shell space for additional beds in the future. Finally, Medical City McKinney is planning a three-story expansion of its own that will add 28 more patient beds for a total of 357, plus four operating rooms, a new post-anesthesia care unit and additional space for day surgery. And Medical City Plano is expanding with 60 more patient beds, bringing the total there to 663, as well as three rooftop helipads, a three-story parking garage and shell space for future patient beds. Located about 40 miles north of downtown Dallas, Celina was the fastest-growing American city among cities and towns with a population of at least 20,000 between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the U.S Census Bureau. We run to it." Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs said the facility is the third-largest employer in the city, aside from the school district and the city itself, with about 250 full time employees. "Just having that facility in its close proximity really lends itself to quality patient care to our residents and the residents of the surrounding area." Before it opened, EMS had to transport patients to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in McKinney, about 14 miles from Celina, which is also expanding. "You may think that a lot of these hospitals are competitors with each other, but I think what I see from behind the scenes is you have very much relationships where they want to work together, where it's really about the patient." Texas Health Resources To help meet the increasing need for services in the area, Texas Health Resources is building the first full-service hospital in Forney. “There is a need with the fast growth in population in the Forney area to really expand care,” said Toya White, who serves as president at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Kaufman and will serve as president of the future Texas Health Hospital Forney. Expanding access to care is something that we’re always evaluating, and really how to meet our population demands.” A spokesperson for the city of Forney said the facility will provide essential services as well as jobs to the community. Along with strong commercial growth, the addition of a world-class, full-service healthcare facility like Texas Health Resources is a tremendous step for Forney," Forney spokesperson Zach Smith said in a statement. "This hospital will not only provide essential services to our residents but will also create high-quality jobs." Texas Health Resources Senior Executive Vice President Laura Irvine said the health system considers population and other demographics when considering where and what types of healthcare facilities are needed in an area. What are the healthcare services that they need, healthcare utilization and what are those current access points.” Beyond demographics, Irvine said Texas Health considers advances in technology to determine what services are needed. We want to make sure we’re matching not just the population and volume of the growth but the type of healthcare needs that they will have.” Irvine said Texas Health has seen the use of e-visits, or virtual visits, increase about threefold in the last year. Explained Irvine: “We’ll want to work with them, make sure they know the services that we’ll be providing from Day 1, and how we’ll work with their EMS and ambulance services that will hopefully provide for them a much faster access for their ambulances than where they are currently driving to." Irvine said the health system also partners with cities and school districts where they plan to build facilities. One example Irvine shared: Texas Health Resources, Forney ISD and the Forney Education Department are partnering on community events and health and wellness initiatives like a Forney ISD back-to-school rally. As health systems plan for new hospitals, Irvine said they work to ensure they have enough land to expand to in the future and that they have planned out where new patient towers or other expansions could go. Late last year, Texas Health Resources also bought 21 acres of land in fast-growing Collin County at the northwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and the Collin County Outer Loop in Celina with plans of expanding there in the future as well. UT Southwestern UT Southwestern broke ground in May on a $177 million radiation oncology campus in Fort Worth to meet a growing need for cancer treatment, officials with the health system said. The 65,000-square-foot facility in Fort Worth's Medical District will include the city’s first MRI-guided precision radiation treatment, four linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation treatment (plus space for two more) and a fully-equipped brachytherapy suite to provide high-dose radiation treatments for patients with prostate or gynecologic cancers. The pediatric health complex will be located on more than 33 acres at the corner of Harry Hines Boulevard and Paul Bass Way, and it will reportedly replace the existing Children’s Medical Center Dallas. In addition to 24-hour nursing care, the hospital will offer physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as private rooms, a therapy gym, an in-house dialysis suite, a dining room, and pharmacy. JPS Health Network, Cook Children's Health Network, the city of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, LVTRise and WestAid Food Pantry have partnered to bring a 40,000-sq-ft health center to the neighborhood, with the ribbon-cutting held August 5 at 2800 S. “The collaboration that has gone into this center is what truly makes it so special, and I’m really honored to say that Cook Children’s is a part of it,” said Rick W. Their fingerprints are all over this project and will continue to guide how we evolve in this space to best serve them.” The neighborhood health center marks the first time JPS Health Network and Cook Children's have partnered to offer healthcare in one facility.

Article: NFL recommends enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following NYC shooting The NFL is recommending enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following a shooting last month at a Manhattan office tower by a gunman authorities say was targeting league headquarters. "However, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities." Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on July 28, before he killed himself, authorities said. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested that he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be diagnosed only by examining the brain after a person dies.

Article: DAKAR, Senegal — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: How it was found Sotheby’s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — The man who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday fired more than 180 shots into the campus and broke about 150 windows, with bullets piercing “blast-resistant” windows and spattering glass shards into numerous rooms, according to information circulated internally at the agency. Two CDC employees who were told about what was discussed at the meeting described details to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to reveal the information. Kennedy issued a statement Saturday that said “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,” and that top federal health officials were ”actively supporting CDC staff.” He did not speak to the media during his visit Monday. Kennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of about COVID-19 shots and other vaccines. Years of false rhetoric about vaccines and public health was bound to “take a toll on people’s mental health,” and “leads to violence,” said Tim Young, a CDC employee who retired in April. “When you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences.” AP reporters Alanna Durkin Richer and Charlotte Kramon contributed to this report.

While the use of the military on American streets is alarming, it should be just as scary how blatantly this president is tying race not just to crime, but to violence so uncontrollable it requires military troops to stop it. It’s a big part of American history and our justice system has unfortunately been steeped in it, from the Jim Crow era to the 1990s war on drugs, which targeted inner cities with the same rhetoric that Trump is recycling now. Trump pointed out some tragic and horrific examples — including the beating of Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, a former employee of the president’s Department of Government Efficiency who was attacked after attempting to defend a woman during a carjacking recently, not far from the White House. But the exploitation we are seeing from Trump is a dangerous precedent to justify military force for domestic law enforcement, which until now has been forbidden — or at least assumed forbidden — by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. While it’s uncertain how that case will resolve, “Los Angeles could provide a bit of a road map for any jurisdiction seeking to push back against the Trump administration when there’s a potential threat of sending in federal troops,” Jessica Levinson, a constitutional legal scholar at Loyola Law School, told me.

Article: The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the “obsolete” H20 chip to China. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,” Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. “Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.” The top Democrat on the panel also raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration. We shouldn’t be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.” Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, reiterated Moolenaar’s point about the constitutionality of the deal.

Niger's government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite's discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

Article: (AP Photo/Charlotte Kramon) NEW YORK -- The man who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday fired more than 180 shots into the campus and broke about 150 windows, with bullets piercing “blast-resistant” windows and spattering glass shards into numerous rooms, according to information circulated internally at the agency. Two CDC employees who were told about what was discussed at the meeting described details to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to reveal the information. Kennedy issued a statement Saturday that said “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,” and that top federal health officials were ”actively supporting CDC staff." He did not speak to the media during his visit Monday. Kennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of about COVID-19 shots and other vaccines. Years of false rhetoric about vaccines and public health was bound to “take a toll on people’s mental health,” and “leads to violence,” said Tim Young, a CDC employee who retired in April. “When you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences.” ___ AP reporters Alanna Durkin Richer and Charlotte Kramon contributed to this report.

Article: Iran’s talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be “technical” and “complicated”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said, ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with it last month in the wake of the June conflict triggered by Israeli strikes. Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that a meeting may be organised with Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi during the IAEA’s visit, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks”. The IAEA’s visit marks the first to Iran since President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country on July 3 to suspend its cooperation with the nuclear watchdog after an intensive 12-day war with Israel. Pezeshkian told Al Jazeera in an interview last month that his country is prepared for any future war Israel might wage against it, adding that he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries. Relations between the IAEA and Iran deteriorated after the watchdog’s board said on June 12 that Iran had breached its non-proliferation obligations, a day before Israel’s air strikes over Iran, which sparked the conflict. “Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes, and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Araghchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past, in negotiations with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear programme will resume, if at all.

Article: Now, they're gearing up to fight again DALLAS — The Skillman Southwestern Library branch is once again slated for closure in Dallas' proposed municipal budget, reigniting a community fight that neighbors thought they had won a year ago. "I'm so angry and I'm so disappointed and I'm heartbroken and I was always heartbroken at the thought of losing this library and losing the staff." Community members Ashley Grossman and Caitlin Dolt, who are both part of a "Friends of Skillman Southwestern Library" group, are preparing to fight the closure again, too. "It's time to do exactly what we did last year again." The proposed budget reflects the city's commitment to public safety, with plans to hire 350 police recruits and retain seasoned officers with a goal of ending the fiscal year with 3,424 sworn police officers. "There just has to be a balance somewhere and there has to be a limit at some point." The repeated fight for the library's survival has taken an emotional toll on residents. The budget documents show the city plans to evaluate closing up to four more library branches in the 2026-2027 budget year as the library system moves to "regionalize" library services.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.

Article: Ralph Norman admitted that Trump’s tariffs are already causing higher prices, but told the American people it’s “for the good of the country.” The South Carolina Republican’s comments were met with immediate criticism, including from “The Weekend” co-hosts Jonathan Capehart and Eugene Daniels, who discussed the impact of Trump’s trade war with fellow MSNBC host Ali Velshi on Sunday. After playing a clip of Norman’s remarks, Capehart pointed out the glaring hypocrisy: “I’m sorry, wait — he said it’s for the good of the country that costs are higher? They just beat the hell out of Joe Biden when he was president because of high prices.” Daniels said Norman showed that Republicans are “accepting the reality” of his trade war. Velshi chimed in and called the tariffs “nonsensical,” going on to say the real losers are America’s small businesses, who have “no leverage.” He added: “They have no lobbying, they have no ability to negotiate, they have no ability to even determine what boat their stuff gets on. Farmers, ranchers — any small business, they can’t do this.” Velshi also discussed Trump’s “dangerous” threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, pointing out “two very distinct problems.” He explained: “Every major industrialized country has a central bank, and they all follow similar rules to make sure that the person who’s the head of the government doesn’t influence. And the problem here is that he wants to influence that.” The second problem, Velshi said, is that “inflation is a much harder problem to handle than recession.” When it comes to a recession, “the government can put money into the economy. It almost wrecked America’s future in the ’80s.” Velshi pointed out that the president has tried to exert this level of control across the government but said the scale of his attacks on the Fed is a cause for grave concern: “This is what Donald Trump is doing all over government, but he’s doing it writ large here and it’s really dangerous.”

Article: CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks Monday in a famine-stricken displacement camp outside of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, killing 40 people, local rights groups said. The Emergency Response Rooms group working at the Abu Shouk displacement camp said in a statement on Facebook that the RSF — which is at war with the Sudanese military — raided parts of the camp targeting citizens inside their homes. Meanwhile, the Resistance Committees in el-Fasher confirmed the attacks, saying on Facebook that the scene “reflected the extent of the horrific violations committed against innocent, defenseless people.” The Resistance Committees are a group of local citizens from the community that includes human rights activists. “Our forces repelled a large-scale attack from several axes by the terrorist militia and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in lives and equipment, as more than 16 combat vehicles were destroyed and burned and 34 vehicles, including armored cars, were captured,” the army claimed in a statement. Meanwhile, in North Kordofan province the RSF has been accused of displacing over 3,000 families from 66 villages due to fighting since early August, according to the Sudan Doctors Network.

Article: The Times reached out to two sources with scenarios that challenge conventional thinking — two plans for the San Fernando Valley, which, half a century ago, provided the space for much of the city’s growth. Vestiges of Reseda’s small-town beginning still survive in block after block of single-story businesses like the Traders pawnbroker and jewelry store at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way. How many more of those would be needed for Reseda, or any similar community, to contribute its fair share of the state’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the city of Los Angeles? The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. Here's how the Pacific Urbanism hybrid model could work The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. 1 MILE The low-density area could see a variety of new building sizes with the largest added along the main corridors At the moment the majority of the structures are one to four unit properties. Those changes have helped, but don’t “get us anywhere close to what’s needed to meet the target, much less in an equitable way where all communities contribute a fair share,” Alvarez said. Pacific Urbanism proposes upgrading the zoning from medium- to high-density near the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way and creating medium-density zones to replace much of what is now single-family residences and small businesses. Bury the transmission lines; build on top If you’ve spent time in the San Fernando Valley, it would be easy to view the overhead electrical transmission lines that stretch for more than 20 miles simply as essential wallpaper of modern living. The lines help ensure that 1.6 million households and businesses across the city can turn on the lights through a mostly uninterrupted band of 100- to 200-foot tall towers on a 150-foot wide strip of land.

SEE ALSO: Texas House Democrats remain out of state as redistricting showdown continues In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton's contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either "directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators" to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for "unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators' Constitutional duties." O'Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in the El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O'Rourke said Paxton was trying to "make examples out of those who fight so that others won't." "Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump, and Abbott have on power in Texas," O'Rourke said.

Article: Donald Trump’s gambits to strong-arm American companies to conform with his political agenda — be they law firms, universities or chip manufacturers — have exposed the fundamental disdain for democratic principles now being practiced by the party of “free enterprise.” Tan is the latest target. Tan visited the White House on Monday, a meeting that followed a post from Trump’s Truth Social account last week accusing him of being “conflicted” and demanding that he resign “immediately.” As Media Matters researcher Matt Gertz noted, the post from Trump’s account came minutes after a Fox Business report on a letter sent by Sen. (Tan, who was born in Malaysia, joins TikTok CEO Shou Chu as a target of Cotton’s Joseph McCarthy-esque crusade against businesspeople with ties to China.) In the letter, Cotton referred to Reuters’ reporting on Tan’s private investments and his previous job at Cadence, a tech company that recently reached a settlement in which it pleaded guilty to illegally selling semiconductor design technology to a Chinese military university. (A spokesperson for Intel told Reuters that Tan had answered questionnaires that included “disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest” and that the company handles such conflicts “appropriately.”) After Monday’s meeting, another post from Trump’s Truth Social account referred to Tan’s rise as an “amazing story” and said Tan and White House Cabinet members are going to “bring suggestions to me during the next week.” Intel released a statement calling the meeting “candid and constructive” and said the company appreciates “the President’s strong leadership.” But as the mercurial president wields his influence, it’s worth noting the facts don’t appear to be as scandalous as Trump or Cotton have implied. In a memo to staff published to Intel’s website Thursday, Tan denounced “misinformation” being spread about him and said he’s “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” The lack of any demonstrable culpability for Tan arguably highlights how blatantly authoritarian Trump’s push to oust him truly is. It’s certainly ironic that the president who eagerly welcomed Elon Musk into the fold despite his financial entanglements with China and their related national security concerns would turn around and insist that the business leader of an independent company must step down over his alleged ties to China.

Article: Trump ordered a takeover of Washington’s police President Trump said yesterday that he was temporarily taking control of the police force in Washington and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in the U.S. During a news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington, a city that he said had been taken over by “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth.” His remarks contrasted with official figures showing that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low. Trump added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” Trump has been threatening to take federal control of Washington for weeks, but he has railed against crime in largely liberal cities for decades. The Washington deployment is the latest example of Trump using the military to achieve his domestic goals; earlier this year, he sent 4,700 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles and deployed some 10,000 troops to the U.S.

Article: How a Red Bull can helped solve mystery of missing cyclist 9 minutes ago Share Save Graeme Ogston BBC Scotland News Share Save Crown Office Tony Parsons was captured on CCTV on the day he set off on his charity cycle ride It was two months into their relationship when Dr Caroline Muirhead's new boyfriend confessed he had killed a man and left him in a shallow grave. Alexander McKellar offered to take her to the spot where the body was buried – and her quick thinking was crucial in cracking a case which had baffled police for three years. Tony's son Mike said that without Caroline's intervention, it was unlikely that his body would ever have been found – and expressed the family's gratitude for what she had done. Police Scotland Tony Parsons was described as a loving father, grandfather and friend Mike Parsons told BBC Scotland News that his dad was the kind of man who was always determined to complete any challenge he set himself. "I actually texted him myself, with what is my dad and myself's sense of humour, a simple text: 'Are you still alive?' "Looking back now, it's not nice to know that was the very last thing I texted to him, knowing at this point he would have been passed away." Caroline Muirhead became a key witness in a murder investigation after her boyfriend of two months confessed he killed a man. "But I basically had to convince my mum there was still a chance, and lying to somebody like that is not easy." Mike Parsons said the McKellar brothers' actions were inhumane Despite numerous public appeals including an appearance by Mike on Crimewatch, it seemed that Tony Parsons had vanished into thin air.

And, again, I think the real key is for folks to not get desensitized to the radicalism of using federalized police, using federalized military authority for ordinary law enforcement contexts in a setting in which the facts don't seem to support it.

Article: The Justice Department is pressing the high court to take a Second Amendment case about a federal law that bars firearm possession by a person who “is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” The issue is due for consideration in the court’s Sept. While Maxwell’s case is far from a sure thing for review — it takes four justices to agree, and they reject most petitions — the Second Amendment issue presents a more likely candidate, at least as it’s presented by the DOJ. In its petition in the case of Ali Danial Hemani — whose prosecution, the government said, is based on his “habitual use of marijuana” — the Trump administration urged the justices to grant review because a lower court said the gun law is unconstitutional. The petition said the high court “has recently and repeatedly reviewed decisions invalidating federal statutes even in the absence of a circuit conflict.” The administration also said there is such a circuit conflict, meaning different federal appeals courts around the country ruling on an issue differently, leaving it to the justices to resolve the dispute nationwide. Hemani’s case and the [appeals court] decision below”; they said that the 5th Circuit didn’t invalidate the federal law in all its applications and that there’s no circuit split needing resolution. Solicitor General John Sauer maintained that the appeal “presents an important Second Amendment issue that affects hundreds of prosecutions every year: whether the government may disarm individuals who habitually use unlawful drugs but are not necessarily under the influence while possessing a firearm.” Though the government’s petition is a plausible candidate for review, it’s ultimately up to the justices whether and when to step in. Notably, they haven’t taken every Second Amendment appeal presented to them over the years, to the chagrin of gun rights advocates and some of the justices, such as Clarence Thomas, who lamented upon the court’s declining to consider a different gun appeal in June that the right to bear arms remains a “second-class” one without the court’s vigilance in enforcing it. Rahimi, a lopsided court ruled 8-1 that the Second Amendment permits temporarily disarming people who have been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another person.

Despite a career that unfolded in fits and starts due to racial tensions, a troubled marriage and the challenges of single motherhood, Jordan recorded one of the most beloved vocal jazz records of the 1960s, Portrait of Sheila on Blue Note Records, and was recognized 50 years later by the National Endowment of the Arts as a Jazz Master, the genre's highest honor. "That's the one I'll dedicate my life to." Jordan, who was white, became good friends with Parker — he called her "the lady with the million dollar ears." In 1952, she married one of his close collaborators, Duke Jordan, and went on to work with many Black jazz artists, often facing prejudice from other white people because of it. "That's how I survived, knowing that once or twice a week I'd get a sitter for Traci, and I'd go and sing in this club, and then I'd get up the next morning and go do my day gig."

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File) MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls — the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon — out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. “We all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,” said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab. That’s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023. Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said “it’s very little,” but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals. So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year. Zambrano highlights that his team’s work has shown that conservation works and that the effort to protect the species is also improving water quality, increasing the number of pollinizers in the area and means that Mexico City makes better use of Xochimilco’s water, among other benefits.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel — New video footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. B’Tselem says it obtained the video from the family of Awdah Hathaleen, 31, an activist, English teacher and father of three who was shot and killed on July 28, and who they said had filmed it. Levi, who is shown firing his gun twice in a video shot by another witness and obtained by The Associated Press, was briefly detained and then released from house arrest by an Israeli court, which cited lack of evidence. The shooting occurred in Umm al-Khair, a village that has long weathered settler violence in an area profiled in the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land.” Settler attacks on Palestinians have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as have attacks by Palestinian militants. “Awdah’s killing is another horrific example of how Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank, are currently living without any sort of protection, fully exposed to Israeli violence, while Israeli soldiers or settlers can kill them in broad daylight and enjoy full impunity while the world watches,” said Sarit Michaeli, the international outreach director for B’Tselem.

Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference near district headquarters, saying that the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding “safe zones” around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.” At least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools. Advertisement The public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, “all the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,” said Carvalho, with the goal of “explaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.” The district also has created a “compassion fund” to provide general help for families, including legal assistance. Los Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which, along with the City of Los Angeles, includes all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

Article: used to tell children in his youth group in Maryland that it was normal for a pastor to kiss boys on the lips, because that’s how Jesus greeted his disciples, according to an arrest warrant made public last week. Pinkerton, 52, a youth minister known as Pastor Tommy, is being held without bond following accusations that he sexually abused six teens from 2006 to 2010 while working at Central Christian Church, an Assemblies of God church in Baltimore County. He gave his life to the community, worked for the community,” Hollimon said, adding that he filed a motion Monday morning seeking another bond hearing for Pinkerton after a judge denied his release last week. “He’s anxiously waiting his day in court.” Pinkerton’s arrest comes as the Assemblies of God, the world’s largest Pentecostal denomination, with nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States, is grappling with a string of child sex abuse allegations. As part of an ongoing investigation into the denomination’s handling of abuse claims, NBC News published an investigation last week based on interviews, emails, court filings and police reports that examined how an Assemblies of God college ministry guided hundreds of students to the home of Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender lauded by some as “the holiest man alive.” Days later, Assemblies of God leaders addressed the issue of sex abuse in the denomination during a biennial gathering in Orlando, defending their handling of the Savala case while also pledging to make changes to prevent similar abuses in the future. The men alleged that when they were in their teens, Pinkerton would give them massages and rub their penises; several said Pinkerton would greet them with what he referred to as a “heavenly kiss” or “brotherly kiss” on the lips, likening this to Jesus. Assemblies of God officials distanced themselves from Pinkerton on Monday, telling NBC News that, although Pinkerton worked at an Assemblies of God church, he was never formally credentialed as a minister with the denomination. “We are so saddened to hear of this report, and are deeply concerned whenever reports like this come out,” said Benjamin Rainey Jr., secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God regional office that oversees the three-state region that includes Maryland. In a statement posted last week on its website, Central Christian said Pinkerton served on its staff more than 15 years ago and hasn’t been affiliated with the church since he left to start his own ministry. In the years since the alleged abuse occurred, Pinkerton has preached in at least six different states, NBC News found, and according to his ministry website, he has evangelized in South America, Europe and Asia. One church where he preached, the New Chapel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is not an Assemblies of God church, posted on its website over the weekend that it had cut ties with Pinkerton before he was arrested. “We were heartbroken to hear of these serious allegations that occurred in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 20 years ago, and communicated the situation to our church family after severing all ties with the accused several months back.

Meanwhile, the national drought group - which includes the Met Office, regulators, the government, and water companies - has warned that England is now suffering from "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The group said England is experiencing widespread environmental and agricultural effects from the shortage of water, which is hitting crop yields, reducing feed for livestock, damaging river wildlife and wetlands, as well as increasing wildfires. A jet stream to the north and high pressure to the east is drawing up hot and humid air from the south As high pressure has pushed eastwards, the UK has been drawing in some very warm air on a southerly to south easterly wind from the European continent, where temperatures have been particularly high. The amber heat health alert – issued by the UK Health Security Agency – begins across the Midlands, East Anglia, London and South East England at 09:00 and continues until 18:00 on Wednesday. Highest temperatures of 2025 England - 35.8C Faversham, 1July - 35.8C Faversham, 1July Wales - 33.1C Cardiff Bute Park, 12 July - 33.1C Cardiff Bute Park, 12 July Scotland - 32.2C Aviemore, 12 July - 32.2C Aviemore, 12 July Northern Ireland - 30C Magilligan, 12 July EPA/Shutterstock Temperatures could reach 34C in the capital Some could see a fourth heatwave of the summer this week, the official criteria for which is when locations reach a particular threshold temperature for at least three consecutive days. There will be a slight shift in wind direction to more of a south-westerly meaning the highest temperatures could be across parts of East Anglia, again in the low 30s. However, as high pressure builds in once more it is likely temperatures will rise again into the weekend to the mid-to-high 20s, with 30C possible in southern England and south Wales.

Article: The reconciliation bill President Donald Trump signed last month increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention budget by more than 300%, making the immigration enforcement machine’s budget comparable to that of some foreign armed forces. ICE has begun hiring thousands of new agents; it is trying to lure recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, and last week Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires. The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy. As we at the American Immigration Council laid out in a recent report, Trump’s second-term immigration policies, in just six months, represent an unprecedented and coordinated assault on democratic rights and principles. And despite the Fifth Amendment’s promise of due process, the administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s hellhole CECOT prison, based on vague, unchallengeable allegations of gang affiliation. In addition to hiring thousands of new ICE agents, the federal government is rapidly expanding detention capacity, filling private jails and converted military sites with thousands of people, most of whom have never been charged with a crime. In immigrant-heavy communities, people are afraid to report real crime — like in Tennessee, where, according to a police chief, a child may have died because their noncitizen caretaker was scared to call 911 given the recent immigration raids in the state. What’s left is a chilling message: No immigrant is safe, no matter their background, status or contribution to society — and mass deportation comes at any cost, including Americans’ safety.

Article: “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” President Trump claimed on Monday, despite falling crime in Washington. President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling. Trump took the lectern in the White House briefing room and said he also intended to clear out the capital’s homeless population, without saying how officials would do it, or detailing where those people would go. 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 ’21 ’23 ’25 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,584 violent crimes in 2025 so far 1,000 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 Instead, Mr. Federal officials were still working out many of the operational details of the president’s plan on Monday afternoon, even though small groups of agents had been conducting limited patrols over the weekend. The effort envisions about 500 federal law enforcement officers, drawn from a host of agencies that operate in Washington, to be used for some version of patrol or support roles of the local police, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the still-developing plan. One complicating factor of using federal agents for essentially street-based police work is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses, so the current view among Trump administration officials is that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain them until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience, the “oceanfront property” in Ukraine and his coming trip to “Russia” — he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. “Why has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?” Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.” Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic.

Article: A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit established by Congress to bolster democracy worldwide that had been paralyzed by the loss of funding earlier this year. Friedrich of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in her 15-page ruling that the Trump administration had withheld funds from the nonprofit “for impermissible policy reasons,” and that the endowment had suffered irreparable harm in the form of layoffs of critical staff members and suspension of several democracy-supporting initiatives. “These harms to the endowment’s global reputation and to the ‘very existence of its programs’ are irreparable,” Judge Friedrich wrote, ordering the release of $95 million in federal funds to the nonprofit — roughly 30 percent of its annual budget. The endowment, which has been denounced by major authoritarian powers like China and Russia, was one of several U.S.-backed human rights groups that fell victim to aggressive cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency, a group led by Elon Musk that sought to slash much of the government soon after President Trump returned to office.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). “This is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,” Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. “In fact, it’s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.” The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia’s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday.

Article: Bank of America thinks the Federal Reserve may want to hold off on cutting interest rates at the end of its next FOMC meeting in the wake of the latest jobs report. "We think those FOMC members that argue for cuts don't put enough weight on the labor supply shock or the fact that inflation is stuck above target, with risks of a larger and more persistent shock after the latest tariff hikes," economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote on Monday. "Cutting in September may risk starting the easing cycle without evidence that inflation has peaked." He also said that he still doesn't expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. "The downward revision to nonfarm payrolls increases the probability of what we view as the most likely alternate scenario: 'bad cuts,' due to deterioration in the labor market," Irigoyen wrote.

Article: Bill Essayli’s request to dismiss charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who has already been convicted of a felony for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest, ordering him to start his prison sentence this month. Wilson said the government’s effort to overturn a jury conviction was “contrary to the public interest.” The ruling brought to a close a criminal case involving an unusual post-trial plea agreement, which triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May and ultimately saw the felony reduced to a misdemeanor. Advertisement In an 11-page ruling, Wilson cited a lack of new evidence or change in circumstances of the case in denying the motion to in effect erase the prosecution of L.A. But after Essayli, a staunch supporter of President Trump, was named top federal prosecutor for the area in April, he ordered a review of the case and sought its unraveling. Advertisement A federal jury found Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law after he violently threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023. “Indeed, after the Court rejected its request for probation and imposed a custodial sentence, the Government responded by seeking to dismiss all charges — ensuring Defendant serves no time at all.” A spokesman for the U.S. Caree Harper, who has served as a victim’s rights attorney for the woman Kirk was convicted of assaulting, celebrated the ruling as a minor victory in the face of Essayli’s broader assault on the case. Late last month, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the judgment against Kirk, citing “misgivings about the case.” They also moved to drop charges in another controversial criminal case, involving Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains. The motions to dismiss came the same day that the Trump administration moved to extend Essayli’s term as L.A.’s top federal law enforcement official, despite flouting the normal confirmation process for prosecutorial appointees. “There’s nothing left.” Essayli’s decision to offer the deputy a lenient postconviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections. Faerstein told jurors Kirk used excessive force against Houseton by slamming her to the ground and pepper-spraying her “when it was unnecessary to do so.” Kirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded. In handing down the four-month sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury’s view, Kirk’s actions were “just plain inexplicable.” He said that Kirk “knew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,” before he pepper-sprayed Houseton. Keenan told the judge that the office found no new evidence but argued not enough attention had been paid to “acts of resistance.” “Didn’t the jury see all that?” Wilson questioned. The jury saw all of it.” After the hearing last week, activists confronted Keenan in the hallway, telling him “this is bigger than Kirk.” Among them was Raycine Ector, the lead organizer of Cancel the Contract Antelope Valley, a community coalition advocating for ending contracts between the Sheriff’s Department and local cities and schools.

Article: The law, Senate Bill 37, is part of a broader effort by Republican lawmakers to assert more control over public universities following years of clashes with faculty over issues like tenure, diversity initiatives and academic freedom. Other university systems, including Texas A&M, University of Houston and University of North Texas, are taking steps to preserve their faculty senates and avoid a gap in faculty representation by restructuring them ahead of the Sept. The University of Houston System said it began planning for a new faculty council earlier this summer, and its board is scheduled to vote on the updated policies and bylaws in August. The Texas Tech University System has indicated it plans to retain its faculty senates in accordance with the new law, though it’s unclear what steps it has taken in that direction. “It’s a head-scratching moment to wonder how and why the effort looks so different,” said Joseph Velasco, a professor at Sul Ross State University, which is part of the Texas State University System. “It risks breaking the thread of shared governance that keeps the university healthy and accountable.” At Sul Ross, faculty who teach at least six credit hours a semester automatically become members of the faculty assembly, a body that functions like a faculty senate and advises the administration. Faculty senates, which have traditionally elected their own leaders and representatives, will look drastically different under SB 37, even at those universities opting to keep their faculty senates and adapt them to comply with the law. “Continuity matters because a functioning faculty senate serves as a check and balance within the university.” Mark Criley, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said the administration could also use the new faculty senates to make it appear as if they have faculty support when they do not. SB 37 requires faculty senates to broadcast their meetings when a majority of members are present, record attendance on critical votes, and post agendas seven days in advance, a stricter standard than the 72-hour requirement under the Texas Open Meetings Act. The law also allows university administrators to remove faculty senate members for “failing to conduct the member’s responsibilities within the council or senate’s parameters, failing to attend council or senate meetings or engaging in similar misconduct.” The law doesn’t define what qualifies as misconduct. Last year, more than 500 professors at Creighton’s alma mater, UT-Austin, signed a petition calling for the removal of then-President Jay Hartzell over his decision to have law enforcement respond to peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. Coby Condrey, a librarian who serves as chair of the UNT faculty senate, said that he expects to continue that strategy under SB 37, and that UNT’s administration will respond in kind. He anticipates the UNT System’s board of regents will authorize faculty senates at their meeting later this month, and said UNT President Harrison Keller has already agreed to consider faculty recommendations when selecting appointees. “We know that it is always going to be better for the faculty to have the administration at least hear our concerns, even if not all of the decisions might be the ones that we would prefer,” Condrey said. Disclosure: Southern Methodist University, Sul Ross University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, University of Houston, University of North Texas, University of Texas System and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: What we learnt from Nicola Sturgeon's memoir 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save BBC Nicola Sturgeon's memoir Frankly is now on sale, slightly earlier than expected after newspaper serialisations and interviews teased some tantalising extracts. Spindrift Isla Bryson was jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape Sturgeon also addresses the case of double rapist Adam Graham who was initially sent to a female prison after self-identifying as a woman called Isla Bryson. "In football parlance, I lost the dressing room." Speaking to ITV News on Monday Sturgeon said she now believed a rapist "probably forfeits the right" to identify as a woman. JK Rowling JK Rowling posted a selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Sturgeon as a "destroyer of women's rights" The former first minister also criticises her highest profile opponent on the gender issue, Harry Potter author JK Rowling, for posting a selfie in a T-shirt bearing the slogan "Nicola Sturgeon, destroyer of women's rights". Her relationship with Alex Salmond Sturgeon's mentor and predecessor as first minster, Alex Salmond, is mentioned dozens of times in the book, often in unflattering terms which reflect their estrangement after he was accused of sexual offences. Salmond won a judicial review of the Scottish government's handling of complaints against him and in 2020 was cleared of all 13 charges but his reputation was sullied by revelations in court about inappropriate behaviour with female staff. "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy," she writes, adding: "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all". The campaign was tough, she says, partly because of what she calls unbalanced coverage by the British media including the BBC and partly because Salmond left her to do much of the heavy lifting. PA Media Sturgeon claims Alex Salmond showed little interest in the "detail" of the independence white paper A key period in the lead-up to the poll was her preparation, as deputy first minister, of a white paper setting out the case for independence. Getty Images Sturgeon described her house as looking like a murder scene Text here Leading Scotland during the pandemic For Sturgeon, the coronavirus pandemic which struck the world five years ago still provokes "a torrent of emotion". She says she will be haunted forever by the thought that going into lockdown earlier could have saved more lives and, in January 2024, after she wept while giving evidence to the UK Covid inquiry, she "came perilously close to a breakdown". PA Media Nicola Sturgeon appeared visibly upset when giving evidence to the Covid Inquiry Text here Misogyny and sexism Scathing comments about the inappropriate behaviour of men are scattered throughout the book. "Like all women, since the dawn of time, I have faced misogyny and sexism so endemic that I didn't always recognize it as such," Sturgeon writes on the very first page. Sturgeon says a male MSP from a rival party taunted her with the nickname "gnasher" as he spread a false rumour that she had injured a boyfriend during oral sex. Nicola Sturgeon says she may have appeared to be a confident and combative leader but underneath she is a "painfully shy" introvert who has "always struggled to believe in herself." She writes in detail about the "excruciating pain" and heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage after becoming pregnant at the age of 40. Sturgeon touches on the end of her marriage, saying "I love him" but the strain of the past couple of years was "impossible to bear." She also writes about her experience of the menopause, explaining that "one of my deepest anxieties was that I would suddenly forget my words midway through an answer" at First Minister's Question Time.

The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute "is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy". "The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be," they said. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year. The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking "substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI". A Charity Commission spokesperson said: "We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us." They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation. Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's "ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders".

Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience, the “oceanfront property” in Ukraine and his coming trip to “Russia” — he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. “Why has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?” Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.” Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic.

The Ukrainian leader’s warnings come in advance of Trump’s scheduled meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, and after the US president said that Kyiv would have to cede land to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a proposition that Ukraine has firmly rejected. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also said on Monday that a peace deal for Ukraine must involve Kyiv and not be imposed upon it. US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which monitors the conflict in Ukraine on a daily basis, said in a recent report that Moscow does not appear to be preparing the Russian public for accepting “a settlement short of a full victory in Ukraine”. European leaders and Zelenskyy plan to speak with Trump in advance of his meeting with Putin as fears mount that Washington may dictate unfavourable peace terms to Ukraine after the Alaska summit.

Article: The bot, which has become widely embraced on X as a way for users to fact-check or respond to other users’ arguments, posted that it had been taken offline over various statements it made regarding U.S and global politics, ranging from claims of genocide in Gaza to discussions about homicide rates by race. At the time, the Grok account acknowledged the posts and said xAI “has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” In a statement posted on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologized “for the horrific behavior that many experienced.” “Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users,” the statement read. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.” In May, Grok was involved in another controversy when it brought up South African “white genocide” claims as responses to unconnected inquires. When users asked why Grok was issuing such responses, the chatbot said its “creators at xAI” instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa and the ‘kill the Boer’ chant, as they viewed it as racially motivated,” according to The Guardian. Grok also acknowledged the glitch, writing that it will "focus on relevant, verified information going forward.” Even with its troubles, Grok has become one of the most public and recognizable AI chatbots due to its integration within X, where it has become a go-to for people looking for context, information and fact-checking. In a series of responses Monday after it came back online, Grok repeatedly stated without prompting that its “account was suspended after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza.” The posts have since been removed.

Article: Just hours after President Donald Trump said he would deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C., a federal judge in San Francisco heard arguments Monday about whether the administration violated federal law when it mobilized troops to Los Angeles this summer. Gavin Newsom and to stop using the military “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law.” The federal government is arguing that the deployment of the National Guard and Marines was solely to support immigration officials, who were impeded by large-scale protests across the city in early June. In response, the Department of Defense ordered some 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as thousands of immigration activists and supporters marched in the streets and outside federal buildings to show their opposition to Trump's mass deportation effort. The state sued the Trump administration for what it called an unwarranted deployment and won an early victory from Breyer, who found the federal government had violated the 10th Amendment clarifying the balance of power between federal and state governments. The case, which is expected to continue through Wednesday, could set a precedent for how the Trump administration handles future deployments of federal troops in D.C., Baltimore and other cities led by Democratic mayors. (Newsom and Bass are Democrats.) “The factual question, which the court must address, is whether the military was used to enforce domestic law, and if so, whether there continues to be a threat that will be done again,” Breyer told the court. Harrington, who did not participate in or witness work in the field, said he raised concerns about the Posse Comitatus Act on June 7 during a task force briefing before federal forces arrived in Los Angeles. During questioning by state Deputy Attorney General Jane Reilley, Harrington said he worried that if the California National Guard was deployed, it would lose law enforcement authority because of the statute and be reduced to a supportive role. That was the case when federal forces accompanied immigration agents to separate operations at Los Angeles' MacArthur Park and a cannabis cultivation center in Camarillo, north of L.A., Harrington said. “The soldiers actually did not engage in any activity.” Prior to deploying at MacArthur Park on July 7, when federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out across the mostly empty space, Harrington received an intelligence report that did “not indicate a high-value target or threat to federal functions at this location,” he said. During an immigration enforcement action in Mecca, a desert community about 142 miles east of Los Angeles, approximately 300 task force soldiers were present, compared to 200 federal law enforcement agents, Sherman said. Breyer appeared to bristle on multiple occasions, at one point arguing with both Sherman and DOJ attorneys about whether federal forces can intervene any time people protest a law they dislike. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, testified that federal intervention was necessary because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd of 1,500 gathered outside the federal building on June 6 to protest immigration arrests. “That impacted our ability to conduct our missions.” Lawyers with the DOJ asked Breyer for a quick judgment at the end of the day, arguing that the state had failed to make its case.

Article: NEW YORK — AriZona Iced Tea's legendary 99-cent price tag may finally face its end after nearly three decades, as company leadership grapples with the financial impact of new aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Don Vultaggio, the founder and chairman of AriZona Beverage Company, told The New York Times he is reluctantly considering raising prices on the company's signature tallboy cans for the first time since 1997, when the iconic 99-cent price was established. Just over a year ago, Vultaggio affirmed his commitment to keeping the price at 99 cents for "the foreseeable future." "I hate even the thought of it," Vultaggio told The Times. "It would be a hell of a shame after 30-plus years." The potential price increase stems from the Trump administration's 50% tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, according to The Times. About 80% of the aluminum AriZona uses comes from recycled material produced in the United States, while the remainder is imported from Canada and now subject to the 50% import duty, The Times reported. Vultaggio told The Times that aluminum prices have been "dramatically bumped up because of this tariff talk," and he expects domestic aluminum manufacturers to raise their prices in response to the tariffs. The 73-year-old founder, whose childhood in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood shaped his approach to affordability, established AriZona's business model around three simple principles: make it taste good, make it look good and price it right. Vultaggio expressed hope to The Times that the tariff dispute will be resolved, but acknowledged that "at some point the consumer is going to have to pay the price" if it is not.

Article: BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out World-famous coral reefs along Western Australia's (WA) coast have suffered the worst bleaching on record after the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave, scientists say. Between last August and this May, warmer water temperatures led to significant heat stress on the reefs, causing many of the coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal. "The length and intensity of the heat stress, and its footprint across multiple regions, is something we've never seen before on most of the reefs in Western Australia," James Gilmour, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), said. In a new report, the Aims researchers found the 2024-25 season was the "most severe coral bleaching on record" for WA coral reefs across both the northwestern and central reefs.

Article: “I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the conference in which he was joined by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control. “Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I’m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act… and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,” he said. “And nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.” According to a report by the news outlet Politico, federal law enforcement officers will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and national monuments. The “rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government”, the order states. “The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.” It also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president “on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia”.

Trump’s nomination of Antoni, who requires confirmation by the US Senate, comes after his firing of Erika McEntarfer earlier this month raised concerns about US government statistics remaining credible and free of political influence. Trump justified McEntarfer’s dismissal by claiming, without evidence, that the latest jobs report, which showed sharply slower jobs growth for May and June than previously estimated, had been “rigged” to make him look bad. After Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with Japan last month, Antoni described the agreement as “darn close” to perfect and the US president and his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as “artistic masters”. Last week, Antoni said in a social media post that there were “better ways to collect, process, and disseminate” economic data, and that the next head of the BLS would need to deliver “accurate data in a timely manner” to rebuild trust in the agency.

Article: You feel much safer.” Snider is among a half-dozen policing and military experts who told NBC News they were perplexed by President Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and order the National Guard to help fight crime in Washington, D.C. as a crime-infested hellscape and said Attorney General Pam Bondi would “take command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.” In making his case, Trump ticked off recent violent incidents in Washington, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern and the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, an original Department of Government Efficiency staffer known online as "Big Balls." “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump said. President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, from left, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from right, during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, on Monday. “However, we emphasize that federal intervention must be a temporary measure, with the ultimate goal of empowering a fully staffed and supported MPD to protect our city effectively.” Concern from former chiefs The announcement of the federal takeover was met with alarm by Art Acevedo, a retired police chief who led departments in Houston, Austin and Miami. “There’s no reason for it other than the political optics sought by the administration to pretend that crime is out of control and they are the saviors.” Trump said that he had appointed the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the head of the Metropolitan Police Department. At her own press conference later in the day, Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions “unsettling and unprecedented.” The attorney general of D.C., Brian Schwab, had also blasted the move and said that he was exploring legal options, but Bowser acknowledged that Trump had the authority to temporarily seize control of the police department. She noted, however, that “nothing about our organizational chart has changed.” Trump must notify certain members of Congress within 48 hours about the reason for taking over control of police and the estimated timeline for federal control, according to the D.C. They know where the violence occurs,” said Snider, who is an adjunct lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a policy director of criminal justice and civil liberties at the R Street Institute, a think tank in D.C. Daniel Hodges, one of dozens of Metropolitan Police Department officers who were brutalized during the riot and whose assailants were among those pardoned by Trump upon his return to office, woke up to the news that Trump had taken over the MPD after working an overnight shift.

"I never thought I would get the chance to put on this uniform again, and I'm blessed to do this again in front of all the fans here in Houston," Correa said. Bregman, who is now a member of the Red Sox, had a decorated career with the Astros including two World Series titles (2017 and 2022) , three All-Star selections, a Silver Slugger Award recipient, and a Golden Glove Award winner. In the game, Bregman, who is no stranger to the Astros' field, scored a two-run home run in the first inning off former teammate Cristian Javier, which gave Boston the early 2-0 lead. Besides the long-anticipated returns of a couple Astros players, Astros infielder Ramon Urias made a statement as he hit his first homerun with the team to give Houston the lead 7-2 in the fifth inning.
