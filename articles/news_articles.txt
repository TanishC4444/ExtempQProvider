Article: The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow’s uncompromising demands in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, Mark Schiefelbein, File) FILE - This combination of photos shows Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, in Moscow on May 9, 2025, and President Donald Trump in Washington on Aug. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, Mark Schiefelbein, File) The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow's uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia’s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit. The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has stood firm in his positions, agreeing to a ceasefire proposed by Trump while reaffirming the country's refusal to abandon seeking NATO membership and rejecting acknowledgment of Russia’s annexation of any of its regions. A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve: In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a “package proposal” for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian -– conditions reflecting Putin’s earliest goals. Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven't been any shifts in the Russian position. It reaffirmed Ukraine’s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance. Although Trump expressed disappointment with Putin, his agreement to meet him without Zelenskyy at the table raised worries in Ukraine and its European allies, who fear it could allow the Russian to get Trump on his side and strong-arm Ukraine into concessions. Trump said without giving details that “there'll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine as part of any peace deal that he will discuss with Putin when they meet Friday. Putin repeatedly warned Ukraine will face tougher conditions for peace if it doesn't accept Moscow's demands as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for the territories of the four annexed by Moscow still under Ukrainian control. “That is potentially a situation that gives Putin a tremendous amount of leeway as long as he can use that leverage to force the Ukrainians into a deal that they may not like and to sideline the Europeans effectively,” Sam Greene of King’s College London said. “The question is, will Trump sign up to that and will he actually have the leverage to force the Ukrainians and the Europeans to accept it?” Putin could accept a temporary truce to win Trump’s sympathy as he seeks to achieve broader goals, Greene said. “He understands that his only route to getting there runs via Trump." In a possible indication he thinks a ceasefire or peace deal could be close, Putin called the leaders of China, India, South Africa and several ex-Soviet nations in an apparent effort to inform these allies about prospective agreements. “However these conditions are worded, they amount to the same demand: Ukraine stops resisting, the West halts arms supplies, and Kyiv accepts Russia’s terms, which effectively amount to a de facto capitulation,” she posted on X. It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.” She predicted Putin might agree to meet Zelenskyy but noted the Kremlin leader would only accept such a meeting “if there is a prearranged agenda and predetermined outcomes, which remains difficult to imagine.” “The likely scenario is that this peace effort will fail once again,” she said.

Article: Iraq’s prime minister has approved disciplinary measures against senior commanders in a paramilitary force after clashes with police left three dead last month Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Baghdad on Monday, July 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Hadi Mizban) BAGHDAD -- Iraq’s prime minister approved sweeping disciplinary and legal measures against senior commanders in a paramilitary force after clashes with police at a government facility that left three people dead last month, his office said Saturday. A government-commissioned investigation found that the former director — who was implicated in corruption cases — had called in members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia to stage the attack, Sabah Al-Numan, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, said in a statement Saturday. Kataib Hezbollah is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of mostly Shiite, Iran-backed militias that formed to fight the Islamic State extremist group as it rampaged across the country more than a decade ago. Al-Sudani approved recommendations to remove the commanders of those two brigades, refer all those involved in the raid to the judiciary, and open an investigation into “negligence in leadership and control duties” in the PMF command, it said. The relationship between the Iraqi state and the PMF has been a point of tension with the United States as Iraq attempts to balance its relations with Washington and Tehran. The Iraqi parliament is discussing legislation that would solidify the relationship between the military and the PMF, drawing objections from Washington, which considers some of the armed groups in the coalition, including Kataib Hezbollah, to be terrorist organizations.

Article: Ruben Gallego in eastern Iowa as the Arizona Democrat criticized President Donald Trump's tax bill at a town hall meeting in Davenport DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Hundreds of people cheered Sen. Ruben Gallego at a town hall meeting in eastern Iowa Saturday as the first-term Arizona Democrat assailed the massive, Republican-backed tax bill signed by President Donald Trump as likely to make “America poorer and sicker.” Gallego's upbeat event struck the opposite tone from Rep. Mike Flood's town hall meeting earlier in the week, when an even bigger crowd jeered the Nebraska Republican for most of a 90-minute event in his state to promote the bill. Democrats, searching for months after last year's election defeat for footing in opposing the aggressive tone struck by Trump in his second term in the White House, have gone on the offensive this month, still united in their frustration with Trump but suddenly energized in full-throated opposition to his signature legislation. “I think this bill is helping Democrats see clearly what’s at stake with the future of protections for so many regular Americans,” said Pete Wernimont of Waterloo, who drove 140 miles (225 kilometers) to see Gallego. “I just hope they are there when it really matters a year from now.” While some Republicans in safe Republican districts are braving crowds to sell Trump’s law, most in Congress are heeding GOP leaders' suggestion to keep lower public profiles, especially noteworthy during the August recess following closely on Trump's signing of the tax cut and spending reduction bill last month. Democratic activists are rallying to point out what they see as the measure's political liabilities for Republicans trying to hold their narrow majorities in Congress in next year's midterm elections. “This is the galvanizing moment that’s happening because Democrats now understand, we're the people that fight for the middle class and the working class of America,” Gallego told reporters before the event Saturday. “This is a clarifying moment for us.” For two hours, the audience of some 300 people applauded and at times stood cheering for the Arizona Democrat, one of several party figures who have been attacking the bill in congressional districts represented by Republicans. “I think we are getting more vocal about it, because we need to speak up.” The meeting contrasted sharply with Flood's meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Monday, when an even larger crowd of 700 voiced vigorous opposition to the bill, locking in especially on its changes to Medicaid, the federally funded health care program for low-income American. The bill, which passed with no Democratic votes in the House or Senate, makes substantial cuts to the health care program, notably by imposing work requirements for many of those receiving aid. For now, Republicans have their work cut out for them if they hope to use the measure as a reason for voters to return them to the majority in the 2026 elections. Gallego used his trip to Iowa, which included a requisite stop at the Iowa State Fair, to burnish his own profile in a state that, until 2020, traditionally had hosted the first event in the Democrats' presidential nominating process.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal ATLANTA -- A Georgia man who opened fire on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. “This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia.” “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a “Dear colleagues” email, and called for his resignation. “Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,” said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration. Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” A request for comment from Vought’s agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the “physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers,” said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. “He emphatically believed that.” But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: “I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.” Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and “quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism,” DeKalb County said. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to “the misinformation, the disinformation” that “caused this issue.” It is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted.

Article: European leaders have welcomed plans by United States President Donald Trump to hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on ending the war in Ukraine, but called for continued support for Kyiv and pressure on Moscow to achieve a just and lasting peace. The statement by France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Commission late on Saturday came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Kyiv will not surrender land to Russia to buy peace. Trump, who has promised to end the three-year war, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties were close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. The European leaders, in their joint statement, stressed their belief that the only approach to end the war successfully required active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, as well as pressure on Russia. “We agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” they said, adding that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Advertisement The leaders said they were ready to help diplomatically and promised to maintain their “substantial military and financial support for Ukraine”. “We underline our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said, adding: “We continue to stand firmly alongside Ukraine.” Chevening talks The statement came after US Vice President JD Vance met British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and representatives of Ukraine and European allies on Saturday at Chevening House, a country mansion southeast of London, to discuss Trump’s push for peace. The Reuters news agency, quoting a European official, said European representatives had put forward a counterproposal, while the Wall Street Journal said the document included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke earlier in the day and promised to find a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine, pledging “unwavering support” for Zelenskyy while welcoming Trump’s efforts to end the fighting, according to a spokesperson for Downing Street. “Ukraine’s future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now,” he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer. Advertisement The summit in Alaska, the far-north territory which Russia sold to the US in 1867, would be the first between sitting US and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in the four regions, and Russia has demanded that Ukraine pull out its troops from the parts that it still controls. Fierce fighting meanwhile continues to rage along the more than 1,000-km (620-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russian forces hold about a fifth of the country’s territory. “Not a single serviceman will agree to cede territory, to pull out troops from Ukrainian territories,” Olesia Petritska, 51, told Reuters as she gestured to hundreds of small Ukrainian flags in the Kyiv central square commemorating fallen soldiers.

Article: Los Angeles officials are pleading with residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills not to flush toilets or water lawns amid a days-long water service outage, saying it could push back repairs. On Tuesday, a valve that controls water flow into the affected communities broke, interrupting service to roughly 9,200 households just as a heatwave gripped the region, with temperatures hitting the high 90s to low 100s . Department of Water and Power issued a notice to boil water in parts of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills, advising that failing to do so “could result in stomach or intestinal illness.” Advertisement By Friday morning, many customers saw their water restored, but DWP urged even those with water in their taps to stop using it. “We are very concerned that if people continue to use the water that is coming out of their faucets today, it is going to delay the ability of the [Los Angeles Department of Water and Power] to get the line back and restored, and for your use of water to be back to normal, so that you don’t have to boil water, so that you don’t have to conserve,” L.A. (Al Seib / For The Times) Advertisement “I know after two days of not having water, when we see that water sort of start trickling into our faucets, that we think all is okay, but in fact we need to build up that pressure,” said L.A. DWP general manager Janisse Quiñones said the city wants to restore the system by 3.a.m on Monday “but that is very dependent on the pressure.” As of 1:30 pm on Saturday, a 10-million-gallon tank serving the area was about 20% full. Advertisement The tank has lost an equivalent of one million gallons during high demand periods,” Quiñones said, “the equivalent of 776,000 toilet flushes.” Some people in the afflicted neighborhoods claim not everyone is following the advisory to lay off the taps. They’re trying to fix it.” Several restaurants in the area reported on social media that they were staying open, relying on bottled water and other beverages, and outside deliveries of ice. A gusher of water spurted into the air and down a street in Granada Hills To start replacing the broken valve, DWP crews had intended to begin emptying the water from the pipe at 8 p.m. Advertisement Crews have excavated 85% of the area and have begun digging by hand around the valve to ensure adjacent oil pipelines, a fiber optic line and a gas line are not affected, Quiñones said.

Article: politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps — including some based in the United States — to check the ages of users across the pond. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software. Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can “view certain mature content.” A spokesperson for the company said r/STD — a message board focused on questions of sexual health — is restricted because of explicit images. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations “create a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.” “We absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms — but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,” Jordan said. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it’s not open to debate in trade talks. The U.K.’s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. While the “primary” focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, “dangerous stunts” and “exposure to harmful substances.” That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft’s Xbox gaming system. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it “strongly.” But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography. Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump’s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British — of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them — but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,” he said. American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws — like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores — would upend the internet closer to home. “Young people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,” wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday.

Winkler recommended canvas for storing bulkier bedding and jackets since the material is more “malleable than a standard under-the-bed plastic storage box.” But that doesn’t mean you should completely cut off plastic — clear plastic can be helpful for knowing exactly what’s inside a container, she added.

Article: That is how long it has been since England lost a match, which agonisingly came in the final of the 2022 World Cup against hosts and perennial champions New Zealand. It is a winning streak that now stretches to 27 games following a comprehensive 40-6 away victory in France, which served as England's final warm-up before the home 2025 World Cup. But this England side, bursting with physicality, confidence and a sense of destiny, chose this moment to register their biggest winning margin over the French for 30 matches, a run stretching back to 2009. That winning margin owed as much to not conceding a try as it did to scoring six, with head coach John Mitchell crediting defence coach Sarah Hunter, who captained England in the World Cup three years ago. There's been a few areas that we've looked at and we feel that if we keep looking at those we'll eventually get the transfer." This XV which started at Stade Andre et Guy Boniface in Mont-de-Marsan is likely to be very similar to the one which commences the World Cup campaign in 13 days' time against the United States at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. Kildunne was not able to add to a record of 14 tries in her last 10 Tests, but showed moments that indicate why she could be the star of the World Cup.

Article: How Kentucky bourbon went from boom to bust 8 hours ago Share Save Robin Levinson King BBC News Share Save Getty Images Bulleit Bourbon reported a more than 7% sales drop this fiscal year As American as apple pie, Kentucky bourbon was booming after the last Great Recession ended. Although the whiskey, which is traditionally made with corn and aged in charred oak barrels, has roots going all the way back to the 18th century, it wasn't until 1964 that it became an iconic piece of Americana, when Congress passed a law declaring it a "distinctive product of the United States". "You often see these kind of generational shifts where people don't want to drink what their parents drink," said Marten Lodewijks, the US president of IWSR, which collects alcoholic beverage data and provides industry analysis. "Everyone was going crazy over the bourbon market, and treating like a commodity, like a stock," recalls Robin Wynne, a general manager and beverage director for Little Sister in Toronto, Canada, who has been a bar manager for about 25 years. that's a very disproportionate response," Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze. Getty Images There are 86 distilleries in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association, and over 10 million barrels of bourbon aging These economic pressures have created a growing list of casualties.

Article: Protesters intensify pressure against Netanyahu plan to expand Gaza war Watch: The BBC's Emir Nader reports from protests against PM Netanyahu's plans for Gaza Israeli leaders have rejected criticism of its plan, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying "this will help free our hostages". Protesters, including family members of 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are still thought to be alive, fear the plan puts the lives of hostages at risk, and urged the government to secure their release. On Friday, Israel's security cabinet approved five principles to end the war that included 'taking security control' over the Gaza Strip, with the Israeli military saying it would "prepare for taking control" of Gaza City. A group representing families of the hostages said on X: "Expanding the fighting endangers the hostages and the soldiers - the people of Israel are not willing to risk them!" One protester Shakha, rallying in Jerusalem on Saturday, told the BBC: "We want the war to end because our hostages are dying there, and we need them all to be home now." "Whatever it takes to do, we need to do it. And if it needs to stop the war, we'll stop the war." Among the protesters in Jerusalem was a former soldier who told the BBC he is now refusing to serve. Max Kresch said he was a combat soldier at the beginning of the war and "has since refused." "We're over 350 soldiers who served during the war and we're refusing to continue to serve in Netanyahu's political war that endangers the hostages (and) starving innocent Palestinians in Gaza," he said. The Times of Israel reported that family members of hostages and soldiers at a protest in Tel Aviv near the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) headquarters called on other soldiers to refuse to serve in the expanded military operation to protect hostages. The mother of one of the hostages has called for a general strike in Israel, although the country's main labour union will not back it, according to the Times of Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also faced strong opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had warned the prime minister that a full occupation of Gaza was "tantamount to walking into a trap" and would endanger the living hostages. "This will help free our hostages and ensure Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future." The Israeli security cabinet's plan lists five "principles" for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing "an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority". Israel began its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: Now some are told to start over toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP via Getty Images The Trump administration is stripping protections of some asylum applicants who filed as far back as 2019. The reason, according to the letters: These asylum-seekers, many of whom entered between 2019 and 2022, did not receive a mandatory screening, known as a "credible fear" interview, at the border. didn't have enough asylum officers to do credible fear interviews for every person crossing the border, given the huge influx of border-crossers starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of the first Trump administration and during the Biden administration, experts told NPR. Sponsor Message "You're literally making documented people, again, undocumented, and they're already in here," said Michelle Marty Rivera, an immigration attorney who has dozens of clients who have received these letters. You're virtually converting people that are following the normal traditional asylum rules and leaving them without a status and without protection and asking them to show their faces to ICE." Lawyers told NPR that in some cases, their clients may have been marked for "expedited removal" when they first entered the country. When asked about the asylum application dismissals, USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said that if upon reviewing an application, USCIS discovers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection designated a person as in "expedited removal," USCIS administratively closes the application due to a lack of jurisdiction. And essentially there's a higher standard that when someone achieves that, then they can then go through the asylum process," said Morgan Bailey, a former USCIS official who served under both Trump and Biden, adding that for the last 15 years, the agency has not been able to keep up with the number of asylum-seekers who need credible fear interviews. "There aren't enough asylum officers to cover the workload, but there has also been such an increase in the number of asylum applications." But now, immigration attorneys are warning that immigrants are facing the consequences of that shortage. "The only way that he's going to be able to proceed is by showing up to ICE, telling them that he has a fear of return, and that will likely get him detained." Arno Lemus, another immigration attorney, sees this effort from the second Trump administration as an attempt to reclassify a certain set of asylum applicants who primarily came in during the Biden years. "They're just doing the process that was allotted to them that was legal and provided to them the moment that they presented themselves in the U.S.," Lemus said, noting that some of his clients have also received the letters. "And now the government's wanting to retroactively go back." Lemus agrees with USCIS that the policy is not necessarily new — the credible fear interviews are the prerequisite to filing for asylum. Sponsor Message Risk of detention is higher than in the past The Trump administration this summer unveiled a new policy requiring immigrants who entered the country illegally to be put in detention without an opportunity for release while they fight their cases. Immigration lawyers told NPR that they are concerned that their clients, who were awaiting their asylum interviews, will get detained if they report to ICE to schedule their credible fear interviews. "You go to court — you get detained; you go to your ICE appointment — you get detained; you go to work — you get detained; you apply for asylum — you were processed incorrectly," Lemus said.

Article: Misha Brown was walking into his local Circle K gas station in Austin, Texas, when he says a teenage boy approached him and asked him to buy him “Feel Free.” When Brown said no, he said he believed the boy tried to grab his wallet. When he went into the store and told the attendant about the teen, she pointed to Feel Free — an herbal drink sold in small, blue, shot-size bottles that claim to offer “relaxation, productivity and focus” — and told him that people were coming in around six times a day to purchase the product, he said in the video. Botanic Tonics, the maker of Feel Free, agreed to pay $8.75 million to settle a 2023 class action lawsuit that claimed it failed to warn consumers about the risks of kratom and because it advertised the product as a safe replacement for alcohol. Botanic Tonics said in a statement to NBC News that “false and misleading claims are being made about feel free on social media and are being perpetuated on news outlets.” “Botanic Tonics has sold over 129.7 million servings of feel free to date. We have received fewer than 1,000 consumer adverse event complaints total across all categories, with zero complaints involving severe addiction,” the statement said, adding that this represents “an exceptionally low complaint rate that contradicts sensationalized social media anecdotes being reported as representative of our customer experience.” What is kratom? Grundmann said he first got involved in kratom research in 2016 at a time when the market for kratom products was “much smaller.” He soon discovered rising demand, which he attributed to kratom’s stimulant, pain-relieving and possibly sedative effects. The FDA says that kratom is “not appropriate for use as a dietary supplement” and that there’s “inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.” It’s often used to self-treat conditions including anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and opioid withdrawal, the agency says. Last month, the FDA recommended that the Justice Department classify 7-OH, one of the two main chemical compounds found in kratom, as an illicit substance due to its potency — a move that would restrict or prohibit access to 7-OH products. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said 7-OH should be classified as a Schedule I substance alongside drugs like heroin, ecstasy and marijuana, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Marc Swogger, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said kratom tends not to be addictive when taken in low doses, but that people may develop a tolerance and need to take more to feel the same effects. “As an addiction medicine doctor, I would never suggest that somebody consume that [Feel Free] that’s in recovery.” (He added he also wouldn’t recommend it to anyone in general because it’s not regulated.) Mac Haddow, a senior fellow in public policy for the American Kratom Association, said, “We’re concerned about any product that has an addiction liability that is classified as causing serious adverse events.” “We strongly support very tough regulations on kratom products,” he added. “We are aware of the reports that people in the Feel Free space are reporting about addiction, as we have people in the kratom space.” Utah has banned the sale of Feel Free products. “State law prohibits the sale of any kratom product that is mixed with other ingredients in a way that alters its quality or strength to the extent that it could be harmful to consumers,” said Caroline Hargraves, the public information officer for Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food. John said he posted his videos because “I just want to try to help people and make a difference.” Brown, who posted the TikTok talking about his experience at the gas station, said he is a former drinker. “If [Feel Free] is something that’s just so easily attainable and is marketed as, like, an alcohol-free substitute or like an energy drink, I think that it’s pretty dangerous.” If you or someone you know is struggling with an alcohol, drug or other substance abuse problem, call the free and confidential helpline of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357), or visit findtreatment.gov.

Dozens of boxes of the popular Labubu toy totaling around $7,000 were stolen from a store in La Puente, California, this week, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "We worked so hard to get to this point, [only] for them just to come in and like nothing take it all away," Joanna Avendano, co-owner of One Stop Sales, told local ABC station KABC-TV on Thursday. Edward Berthelot/Getty Images, FILE Alex DePaoli, an associate teaching professor of marketing at Northeastern University's School of Business, told ABC News that part of the Labubu appeal comes from their marketed rarity and the way they are sold through a "blind box" system. "[It's a] system essentially where you don't know what's in the box, you hope that what's in the box is what you want," DePaoli said in an interview that aired Friday on "Good Morning America." "If you don't get what you want, you've got to go buy another one. A lot of folks have sort of likened that sort-of system to almost gambling." The market for Labubus has become so popular that some consumers are turning to counterfeit alternatives known as "Lafufus," which are made with lower-quality materials and may have different features than authentic Labubus.

Article: Researchers at the University of Arizona’s Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center call him Jaguar Number Four, a big cat that roamed across the United States-Mexico border through the San Rafael wildlife corridor. The sightings excited the Wild Cat Center’s team, as it showed the wildlife corridor had not yet been interrupted by the southern border wall, which partially bisects the sprawling grasslands and woodlands that ocelots, mountain lions, bobcats and, yes, even jaguars, traverse. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement However, the researchers’ fears have not completely abated, as construction on a 27 mile segment of the wall is estimated to begin in late August under the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on migrant crossings. The lawsuit challenged Noem’s authority to waive “bedrock environmental protections” to quicken construction, arguing that it would destroy the “border’s last remaining significant wildlife corridor.” “It would certainly be an existential threat to the natural recovery of jaguars north of the border,” said Russ McSpadden, a southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. So when researchers see male jaguars trekking into southern Arizona, it’s a positive sign that the ecosystem is able to support everything from “the smallest herbivores to the largest apex predators,” Malusa said. But jaguars north of the border, which could still include Jaguar Number Four, would be unable to travel to Mexico and eventually die as the last of its kind in the U.S. He popped up in the months after a shipping container border wall ordered by former governor Doug Ducey (R) was dismantled after an agreement with the Biden administration and intense criticism from environmentalists, local residents and officials. The latest detection was July 4, but because the Wild Cat Center’s volunteer researchers have to manually visit the trail cameras in oftentimes rugged terrains, researchers did not learn about it until Aug.

Article: — Their time in this small Midwestern town was nearly over, but for now, Mike Phelan still had a business to run, so he and his daughter leashed their dog and headed up the street. When they moved here from Chicago five years ago, Mike discovered Vermillion had a university, locally made bread Oprah Magazine once declared the best in the world, and an author who’d won the National Book Award. No university town should exist without a place to buy novels and new nonfiction, Mike thought, so he’d opened one and named it “Outside of a Dog” after a Groucho Marx quote — “Outside of a dog, a book is man’s best friend.” Mike twisted the key and looked down Main Street. But in the morning, his wife and son would head east with a trailer, and soon, Mike and his daughter, whom The Washington Post is not naming to protect her, would follow with a truck. For a while, the 5-year-old held her arm in the hallway and pretended it was broken, but eventually, she stopped eating and drinking at school to avoid having to go. Just nine of its 105 lawmakers are Democrats, and when Vermillion passed its policy, it became the only district in the state to explicitly allow trans girls to use the girls’ bathroom. “How evil!” Though the state’s anti-trans bills had come to dominate their life the past few years, most of the Phelans’ parenting consisted of the normal stuff — they negotiated bedtimes and dirty bedrooms, junk food intake and the best way to spend a summer. A group of customers had told Mike they were planning a “Phelan Pharewell” at a brewery on Main Street, and when Mike walked over, he expected he’d find maybe a small group. The sun fell, and no one left, but Mike knew Jen and Calvin needed to get on the road early, so he grabbed a microphone and thanked everyone for the past few years. “I’m sorry that there is an end to our time in Vermillion.” In the future, when Mike thought about Vermillion, he knew he’d always feel it had been taken from his family too soon.

Article: This screengrab shows smoke and fire rising from an industrial facility, which, according to the governor of Russia's Saratov region, was damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack, in Saratov, Russia, on August 10, 2025. So far in August, Russia's Defense Ministry has reported downing 1,117 Ukrainian drones -- an average of around 117 per day, marking a notable increase on July's daily average of 97 drones downed. July saw Russia set a new record number of aerial attacks, launching a total of 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine across the month, with a daily average of around 201 drones and six missiles per day. Since Trump announced that he would meet with Putin in Alaska on Friday, Ukrainian officials have gone on a diplomatic offensive to bolster the Western coalition in support of its peace demands. Putin, though, is demanding that Ukraine cede several regions -- not all of which are controlled by Russian troops -- in the south and east of the country, accept curbs on the size and sophistication of its military and be permanently excluded from NATO. Russia's demands, Zelenskyy has said, constitute an attempt to "partition Ukraine." Speaking from the White House on Friday, Trump suggested a settlement could include "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy swiftly rejected the proposal, saying Ukraine "will not give Russia any awards for what it has done" and that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." "Our positions were clear: a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognizing the occupation," Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's influential chief of staff, said in a Saturday statement after taking part in talks with Vice President JD Vance in the U.K. Gleb Garanich/Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among the European leaders to sign a joint statement expressing their support for Kyiv in any peace negotiations. "We welcome President Trump's work to stop the killing in Ukraine, end the Russian Federation's war of aggression and achieve just and lasting peace and security for Ukraine," the statement read.

Article: All over the world, as the United States retreats from the global order it created, nations are reforming their priorities, changing their institutions and, as a result, changing their identities. Canadian travel to America continues its steep decline, although that may have less to do with political resistance than with the fact that the United States has made spectacularly clear that foreigners within its borders may be subject to detention, and possibly even violence, without recourse. (There’s no replacement for bourbon.) But the second Trump administration has established a more enduring truth about the United States: It is no longer a country that keeps its agreements.

Article: In the wake of January’s horrific fires, detractors of Los Angeles — an urban reality often seen as a toxic mixture of unsustainable resource planning and structurally poor governance systems — are having a field day. Their criticism is not new: For most of the 20th century — and certainly for the last five decades or so — Los Angeles has been seen by many urbanists as less city and more cautionary tale — a smoggy expanse of subdivisions and spaghetti junctions, where ambition came with a two-hour commute. Advertisement In 1961, Jane Jacobs , the famed urban theorist and community activist, referred to “the ballet of the good city sidewalk” in her landmark 1961 book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities.” If Manhattan was her “ballet of the sidewalk,” L.A. Advertisement That vast, polycentric mass — long derided by urban experts residing in denser cities — can also be an asset in the years ahead as autonomous mobility becomes ubiquitous. Elastic, demand-driven autonomous services — which will inevitably also extend to Los Angeles airspace — can and will complement an increasingly built-out Metro light rail system and increased bus rapid transit routes, helping open up economic opportunities to those in once disadvantaged, isolated neighborhoods. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Los Angeles is even emerging as a global pioneer in rethinking the curb — often treated as an afterthought — looking at ways those stretches of sidewalk can serve new functions: a charging node, a logistics port, a civic gathering point. Rather than a singular large park like New York’s Central Park or Boston Common, the city could develop an ecological mesh, a “sponge city” capable of managing stormwater and heat while fostering public life. “No city has ever been produced by such an extraordinary mixture of geography, climate, economics, demography, mechanics and culture,” said Reyner Banham , the British architectural historian who wrote about Los Angeles a half-century ago.

Article: Members of Cal Fire, various fire agencies and tech companies learn about an autonomous Black Hawk helicopter, part of new California wildfire fighting technology, at the Silverwood Welcome Center on April 25 in Hesperia. An autonomous Sikorski Black Hawk helicopter, powered by technology from Lockheed Martin and a California-based software company called Rain, is on display on the tarmac of a logistics airport in Victorville — the word “EXPERIMENTAL” painted on its military green-black door. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change. And I think that if we look hard at what is likely coming over the decades ahead, there’s no time to waste.” Indeed, the outlook for wildfire activity in the years and decades to come is concerning. That’s largely because human-caused climate change is driving up temperatures and drying out the landscape, priming it to burn, according to Kate Dargan Marquis, a senior advisor with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation who served as California’s state fire marshal from 2007 to 2010. “It’s not really a controversial issue: Fires are going to increase in size, intensity and frequency across the western United States — probably globally in large measure — and it’s because the atmosphere is getting hotter and drier,” Dargan Marquis said. So we have to ramp up on all of those.” It wasn’t all that long ago that firefighters were using paper maps and bag phones to navigate and respond to wildfires. Today, more than 1,100 mountaintop cameras positioned across California are already using artificial intelligence to scan the landscape for the first sign of flames and prompt crews to spring into action. NASA’s Earth-observing satellites are studying landscape conditions to help better predict fires before they ignite, while a new global satellite constellation recently launched by Google is helping to detect fires faster than ever before. Much of the innovation is coming from Southern California, according to Dan Munsey, chief of the San Bernardino County Fire Protection District who also chairs the technology committee of the International Fire Chiefs Assn. We need to change the way we’re doing business.” Such changes must include a top-down reconsideration of infrastructure, budgets and training, he said, which should occur in conjunction with the launch of satellite dishes, autonomous helicopters and drones, AI-powered cameras and other new tools. As advanced as they may seem, the current tools are only scratching the surface of what’s possible, according to Kirk McKinzie, a 35-year fire service veteran who studies and consults on fire service technologies. Think augmented reality helmets that will allow firefighters to create a 3-D image of a burning building in real time — including mapping exits, locating people in need of assistance and alerting crews ahead of a smoke explosion or structure collapse with time to spare. Cost estimates for future technology are speculative and difficult to come by — its hard to say, for example, what a smart fire truck will cost in 2050 — but AI-powered rigs and autonomous helicopters will probably run fire departments millions of dollars. “The question is, how do we get there, with due digital safeguards, yet swiftly?” He painted a picture of Los Angeles as a smart city — in which electric fire and EMT aircraft zip across the sky, utility grids detect ignition sources instantly, and houses can even douse themselves in fire retardant or gel ahead of advancing flames. Robots, too, will be used to fight fire in high-risk situations — as was already done in 2019 when a firefighting robot named Colossus, developed by the firm Shark Robotics, battled flames searing through Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Indeed, much of this technology is already in development or in existence from companies such as Verizon and AT&T and technology firms such as Pivotal, ERIS, Magic Leap, Qwake and FLAIM, which are pioneering personal response aircraft, augmented reality software, heads-up displays and thermal imaging devices, among other smart tools for firefighters. One project in development from the Department of Homeland Security and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known as AUDREY, or the Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction and Synthesis, which will use AI to track fire crews as they move through an environment using head-mounted displays or mobile devices, collecting data to guide them through flames and monitor for danger. “Whether that is an expanded early response, whether it’s an early notification to citizens to preserve property and life, or an intelligent grid to inform infrastructure entities responsible for water supplies of a pending shortage, it is a multi-factor equation.” Advertisement In fact, finding water is also an issue that experts hope to soon resolve. During the Palisades fire, crews reported that scores of fire hydrants ran dry or suffered from low pressure, while a reservoir in the area sat empty as the fire burned . One group tackling this problem is Wildfire Water Solutions, a startup that brings water directly to the scene of a fire through a system of mobile pumps, pipes and tanks, saving crews valuable time that is often spent transporting water tenders and securing their own supplies. The system can deliver a continuous flow of more than 150,000 gallons of water per hour up to 50 miles away from its source, according to Chief Executive Mike Echols. “I’m not going to say anything can prevent an act of nature like that, but just think about having a continuous water supply network to disperse wherever it’s needed.” Another forward-looking firm, Frontline Wildfire Defense, has created a sprinkler system that uses fire-tracking technology to detect blazes near a home. Proposed federal legislation known as the “Fix Our Forests Act,” which is currently working its way through Congress, calls for the development of a suite of a high-tech products among its plans for managing forests and reducing wildfire threats, including AI and augmented reality tools, infrared-equipped low-Earth orbit satellites, and quantum computing applications. Meanwhile, a state assembly bill, AB 270, would direct the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to establish a pilot program to assess the viability of incorporating autonomous firefighting helicopters in the state. The agency in 2023 opened its own Office of Wildfire Technology Research and Development, which is dedicated to investigating new tools for emergency response, including ways to enhance firefighters’ situational awareness and to use AI to power drones, data collection and post-fire analyses. For years, the majority of the state’s residents and firefighting agencies have operated under an ethos that all fire is bad — ignoring Indigenous burning practices and the fact that fire has been a natural part of California’s landscape since long before humans ever arrived. “We have some challenges in front of us recognizing that there is a need for fire in many landscapes,” said Dargan Marquis, the former state fire marshal, who also spent 30 years as a firefighter and chief. In addition to advancing new firefighting technology, “how do we also, at the same time, hold in our heads and in our strategies and in our goals that fire is beneficial?” Advertisement Though much of present progress is by necessity focused on extinguishing flames, she hopes that in the years ahead, experts and technology will also find ways to incorporate as much “good fire” as possible. “We can see a pathway to moving our technology, our fire service, our social acceptance and our entire wildfire perspective through an understanding — an arc of change — where fires become manageable events and then eventually, in 50 years, we can see them as valuable opportunities,” she said. Wind is a huge factor in many fires — including the Palisades and Eaton fires — and sending autonomous aircraft in when it’s too dangerous for humans to fly is among his goals. “The thing that keeps me up at night, and gets me up in the morning, is moving faster in advancing these technologies that we have — that are already here — so that we can start moving faster towards this future,” Brodie said.

California UCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant negotiations, Newsom says Making his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do ‘the right thing.’ Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly of cancers, but Campbell’s work could lead to a better understanding of it, paving the way for more robust prophylactic programs — and treatment plans — that may ultimately help tame the scourge. After professor Dino Di Carlo, chair of the UCLA Samueli Bioengineering Department, learned about 20 grants were suspended there — including four in his lab worth about $1 million — he felt a profound sadness. Advertisement So Di Carlo, who is researching diagnostics for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, took to LinkedIn, where he penned a post invoking the Franz Kafka novel “The Trial.” The unsettling tale is about a man named Josef K. “Like Josef K., the people actually affected — the public, young scientists, patients waiting for better treatments and diagnostic tools — are left asking: What crime did we commit?” wrote Di Carlo. “A rapid, point-of-care test would allow individuals to receive immediate results, enabling early treatment with antibiotics when the disease is most easily addressed, significantly reducing the risk of chronic symptoms and improving health outcomes.” Advertisement Di Carlo lamented what he called “a continual assault on the scientific community” by the Trump administration, which has canceled billions of dollars in National Institutes of Health funding for universities across the country. Di Carlo said he was in meetings all week to identity which researchers are affected by the cuts, and to try to figure out, “Can we support those students?” He has also sought to determine whether some could be moved to other projects that still have funding, or be given teaching assistant positions, among other options.

Article: In 2019, when the Thai government announced plans to turn an abandoned tobacco factory in the nation’s smoggy capital into a public park, Bangkok-based landscape architect Chatchanin Sung saw an opportunity to address another of the city’s chronic problems: flooding. As a result, the city’s network of over 1,600 urban canals, which were once used for transporting goods and people but now primarily act as stormwater channels, are regularly overwhelmed. “The park project was an opportunity to absorb and clean this water.” To design the new space, a 102-acre expansion to the pre-existing Benjakitti Park, Chatchanin partnered with Kongjian Yu, a Beijing-based landscape architect who has long advocated what is known as a “sponge city” model of urban water management. The idea is that, unlike “gray” infrastructure, which is designed to flush water away as quickly as possible, cities like Bangkok can mitigate flood risk simply by making its surfaces more absorbent like a sponge, capturing stormwater before it can turn into runoff that pollutes streets and strains drainage systems. Their winning design, which was opened to the public three years ago, was realized in just 18 months and reflects the idea that such urban water management systems can also provide valuable aesthetic and recreational benefits to communities. (Sakchai Lalit / Associated Press) Fed by a nearby canal, a long system of wetlands containing thickets of aquatic plants removes pollutants from the water as it winds around the park’s perimeter, releasing what’s left into a large pond dotted with small islets. (Sakchai Lalit / Associated Press) She pointed to the pond, which no longer had the foul odor or the oily sheen of the canal despite being just a few steps away. It all comes back in the end.” The idea that cities need to adapt to — not outrun — their floods has been a lifelong preoccupation of Kongjian Yu, whose work with sponge cities has earned him the prestigious Oberlander International Landscape Architecture Prize and comparisons to Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York’s Central Park. At the time just 10 years old, Yu had been playing on the banks of his village’s river, which was more voluminous than usual due to heavy monsoon rains, when he suddenly found himself being swept away by the powerful currents. Later, Yu earned a landscape ecology degree from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design and spent two years in Los Angeles working for SWA Group before returning to China in 1997. Dismayed that the rapidly modernizing country had lined its cities with concrete dams and channelized waterways, Yu began writing to local mayors, warning of the risks of this approach and advocating instead for “rewilding natural water systems.” “Sponge cities follow three principles: retain, slow down and embrace water,” Yu said. sent to demolish Chinese infrastructure.” But things changed in 2012, when severe flooding in Beijing destroyed thousands of homes and killed 79 people, some of whom were caught off-guard in the street. “People dying in the street — that was the critical point.” The floods prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to adopt Yu’s sponge city philosophy as a national agenda in 2015. Since then, the government has pledged more than $28 billion to help fund over 33,000 sponge city projects in 90 cities, aiming to have them capture and reuse at least 70% of their rainwater by 2030. By 2020, over 40,000 sponge city projects were completed nationwide, contributing to around 3.8 trillion gallons of rainwater being recycled that year, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. Others, like a mangrove forest built on the banks of a river in the tropical southern city of Sanya on Hainan Island, act as a natural buffer against saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion from rising sea levels. “Instead of building a wall, we allow the water to come in.” Advertisement Women stop near ponds and water plants at the “Fish Tail” sponge park that’s built on a former coal ash dump site in Nanchang in north-central China’s Jiangxi province. Yu scribbled the design on a napkin during his flight to Bangkok to meet Chatchanin, keeping it simple enough to be achievable — at least in theory — with only a single excavator. It’s about combining gray and green — upgrading the current model.” Advertisement Since 2006, Singapore has been turning its own waterways and reservoirs into public parks that also absorb stormwater, an initiative known as the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) Among the efforts to make the city spongier — and therefore less dependent on imported water — is the Safe Clean Water Program, which L.A. And although the program has recently begun to pick up pace, with around $1 billion allocated across 130 projects, Bruce Reznik, the group’s executive director and a member of the Measure W scoring committee, pointed out there are a host of challenges not present in China’s centralized model. I think we’ve got to figure out ways that we can streamline some of this stuff.” Special correspondents Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul and Xin-yun Wu contributed reporting from Bangkok and Taipei, respectively.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

All of which only makes the tragedies and disappointments of the present more onerous as we address racist politicians, crooked developers, neglected neighborhoods, the arrival of federal immigration agents — and large swaths of the region in ashes: more than 57,000 acres burned, more than 16,000 structures destroyed, livelihoods wiped out, lives lost or displaced. But the January fires come with an imperative: to think about how we want to live in Los Angeles, despite the recklessness of the past and the persistent denial of the present.

But the Trump administration, which is likely to hold steady up to and beyond the point at which Mar-a-Lago is underwater, has all but declared war on the Golden State’s good intentions, eliminating funding for key projects and challenging the state’s authority. Meanwhile, a grim analysis last year , which can’t be blamed on Trump, said the state would have to triple the pace of progress to reach its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target. As for the law requiring seismic upgrades of hospitals by 2030, as of 2023, nearly two-thirds had yet to complete the required improvements and many had asked for amendments and extensions.

Chun / Los Angeles Times) The scenario might seem improbable, but according to firefighters, architects and futurists, it’s a realistic outline of what L.A.’s fire defense could look like in 2050. Devastating fires have pummeled Southern California in the last several decades, shifting the public conversation from fire suppression to fire preparedness and mitigation as governments begrudgingly acknowledge the disasters as regular occurrences. Michael Kovac designed his home in Pacific Palisades The house is clad in fiber cement; the roof is made of fireproof TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin); the deck is made with specially treated wood for fire resistance; and a fire suppression system in the back of the house sprayed fire retardant onto the vegetation. Before fleeing the fire, Kovac loaded all his valuables into a room wrapped in concrete and equipped with a fire door capable of keeping out smoke and flames for three hours. But Kovac also installed some DIY upgrades for next to nothing, including dollar-store mesh screens on all his vents to block embers from entering — another frequent cause of fires spreading. “Now there’s a clean slate, so the neighborhood we build next will be more fire-resilient.” The front garden at Michael Kovac’s home is filled with succulents and native plants and covered in volcanic rocks instead of mulch. “You can’t knock down all of California and start new, but you can mitigate portfolio damages by making new parts of the portfolio better.” California Can fire-gutted suburbs rebuild safer? Here’s what the experts say Though no community can be made fireproof, discarding past urban design practices could make areas abutting wilderness safer from the kind of wildfire that hit Altadena and Pacific Palisades. That way, you at least have something to get back to.” Some home builders and designers are offering fire-resilient designs as demand continues to grow in the wake of the fires. Even traditional concrete, which stands up to the elements better than wood, runs roughly 20%-50% more than wood for home building, and building a fire-resistant home adds tens of thousands of dollars to the building cost, according to most experts. In addition to being a professor of architecture at the University of San Diego and a futurist, López-Pérez is the founder of Polyhaus , a home-building startup that says it can assemble a house in three days.

He hopes 2050 brings more safety precautions for his team, such as personal respirators for every firefighter and fleets of trucks that share their location in real time for better communication between departments, and he imagines fleets of drones flying alongside firefighting aircraft. He’s also optimistic about funding and said he’s never seen so much legislative interest in putting money toward fire services as he has in the wake of the January fires. The Los Angeles Fire Department is one of the few city departments poised to gain new hires under Mayor Karen Bass’ $14-billion spending plan released in April, which proposed adding 227 fire department jobs while cutting 2,700 jobs in other departments.

Article: But the future president of the United States has a far less heavenly opinion, predicting in a fiery campaign address that the “sinful” city will be destroyed by an earthquake “in divine retribution.” Days after the remarks, a massive quake devastates most of Los Angeles and many of its landmarks, including downtown’s Bonaventure Hotel, Union Station and the Santa Monica Pier. After amending the Constitution to allow him to be president for life, the commander in chief issues a directive that separates Los Angeles from the rest of the country, transforming it into a deportation center for those found “too undesirable or unfit” for the new “moral America.” Cut! Advertisement John Carpenter directed and co-wrote “Escape From L.A.” (Kyle Cassidy) Carpenter, best known for creating 1978’s “Halloween,” which launched a fresh new wave of horror movies, belongs to a legion of filmmakers who’ve put Los Angeles in their creative crosshairs, aiming their wrecking balls at its palm trees, skyscrapers and world-famous landmarks. From 1953’s “The War of the Worlds” through 1982’s “Blade Runner” and 2013’s “This Is the End,” vast areas of the city have fallen victim to a variety of calamities, including earthquakes (“Earthquake,” 1974), tornadoes (“The Day After Tomorrow,” 2004), comets (“Night of the Comet,” 1984) and underground eruptions (“Volcano,” 1997). Aliens from outer space appear to have a particular disdain for Los Angeles, as evidenced by “War of the Worlds,” “Independence Day,” “Battle: Los Angeles” and “Skyline.” In “Independence Day,” alien invaders target and destroy Los Angeles. (©20th Century Fox.) “Blade Runner” — “the official nightmare of Los Angeles,” according to filmmaker and critic Thom Andersen — depicts a dark, heavily polluted urban center with flying vehicles and residents drenched in a constant downpour of acid rain. The film’s narrator quotes the late Mike Davis, a noted historian and urbanist, when he says that Hollywood “takes a special pleasure in destroying Los Angeles — a guilty pleasure shared by most of its audience.” Advertisement Films depicting the fall of Los Angeles have long been a reliable draw for movie audiences. The movie opens with a bird’s-eye view of Los Angeles’ picturesque skylines, reservoirs and grassy hillsides before the bold-faced title appears, accompanied by ominous music courtesy of legendary composer John Williams. (Those images share an eerie similarity with some of the horrific scenes from the recent destructive wildfires that swept through Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena in January.) Los Angeles also winds up in harm’s way in “San Andreas” (2015), starring Dwayne Johnson as a top search-and-rescue helicopter pilot with the Los Angeles Fire Department. Advertisement Still, “Los Angeles Plays Itself” narrator Encke King says that “the entire world seems to be rooting for Los Angeles to slide into the Pacific or to be swallowed up by the San Andreas fault.” The documentary highlights a sequence in 1996’s “Independence Day” in which a group of revelers go to the top of the First Interstate World Center, now known as the U.S. “There’s a certain undertone of ‘good riddance’ when kooks like these are vaporized by the earth’s latest ill-mannered guests.” The famed Hollywood sign is history in the wake of a devastating series of tornadoes in “The Day After Tomorrow.” (Twentieth Century Fox) Brad Peyton, director of “San Andreas,” says the lure of these disaster films is largely driven by the city’s landmarks: “There are all these landmarks that are easily recognizable all over the world. It’s a big target for filmmakers like me who are making movies for the world to see.” Paul Malcolm, senior public programmer at the UCLA Film & Television Archive, has a different take: “Los Angeles is a city of constant change — it reinvents itself, tearing down old buildings and putting up new ones. Maybe Hollywood is processing its own anxieties about change and inflicting upon its hometown.” Advertisement In addition to the scenes that highlight spectacle and moments of heroism, some filmmakers also include more serious issues about disaster preparedness and structural shortfalls. Peyton, who is from Canada, remembers being in an underground garage somewhere in Los Angeles and thinking “this would be the worst places to be stuck if an earthquake ever hit. That thought lodged in my mind for years.” In “Volcano,” an underground volcano erupts under MacArthur Park, sending rivers of lava through the subway system and spilling out from the La Brea Tar Pits onto Wilshire Boulevard’s Museum Row. She criticizes local officials who approved an underground subway, saying: “The city is finally paying for its arrogance, building a subway under land that is seismically active.” Author and filmmaker Craig Detweiler (“Remand”) said the popularity of the “wreck L.A.” films could also be inspired by envy: “For audiences who hate California, there’s a certain schadenfreude in seeing it destroyed because of this jealousy of our wealth as well as our weather.” The popularity of such fare once inspired its own subgenre — “Los Angeles Destroys Itself” — curated by the UCLA Film & Television Archive for the Los Angeles Film Festival. The slate included 1988’s “Miracle Mile,” where the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard becomes the center of a riot, filled with residents terrified by reports of incoming nuclear missiles.

(Lorey Sebastian / 20th Century Fox) Advertisement Greg Strause, who directed “Skyline” and founded a special-effects company with his brother Colin, agrees that viewers take guilty pleasure in seeing Los Angeles landmarks ripped to shreds. “Skyline” stars Eric Balfour and Scottie Thompson as Jarrod and Elaine, a Brooklyn couple who travel to Los Angeles to help Jarrod’s friend, wealthy entrepreneur Terry (Donald Faison), celebrate his birthday. At one point during a break in the attack, a distressed Elaine, who is pregnant, says quietly, “I hate L.A.” “Skyline” was released in 2010, and even though Hollywood has not set its sights on destroying Los Angeles in the last few years, UCLA’s Malcolm would not be surprised if they made a resurgence: “There will always be an audience for those films, where we can experience safely what we always dread.”

Article: Ever since federal immigration raids ramped up across California, triggering fierce protests that prompted President Trump to deploy troops to Los Angeles, the state has emerged as the symbolic battleground of the administration’s deportation campaign. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from the Deportation Data Project , Texas reported 26,341 arrests — nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests nationally — followed by 12,982 in Florida and 8,460 in California. Advertisement Even in June, when masked federal immigration agents swept through L.A., jumping out of vehicles to snatch people from bus stops, car washes and parking lots, California saw 3,391 undocumented immigrants arrested — more than Florida, but still only about half as many as Texas. When factoring in population, California drops to 27th in the nation, with 217 arrests per million residents — about a quarter of Texas’ 864 arrests per million and less than half of a whole slew of states including Florida, Arkansas, Utah, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and Nevada. Immigration experts say it is not surprising that California — home to the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the nation and the birthplace of the Chicano movement — lags behind Republican states in the total number of arrests or arrests as a percentage of the population. Advertisement Part of the reason Republican-dominated states have higher arrest numbers — particularly when measured against population — is they have a longer history of working directly with ICE, and a stronger interest in collaboration. In red states from Texas to Mississippi, local law enforcement officers routinely cooperate with federal agents, either by taking on ICE duties through so-called 287(g) agreements or by identifying undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated and letting ICE into their jails and prisons. Indeed, data show that just 7% of ICE arrests made this year in California were made through the Criminal Alien Program , an initiative that requests that local law enforcement identify undocumented immigrants in federal, state and local prisons and jails. And other conservative states with smaller populations relied on the program even more heavily: 75% of ICE arrests in Alabama and 71% in Indiana took place via prisons and jails. “State cooperation has been an important buffer in ICE arrests and ICE operations in general for years,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Sacramento-based senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “We’ve seen that states are not only willing to cooperate with ICE, but are proactively now establishing 287(g) agreements with their local law enforcement, are naturally going to cast a wider net of enforcement in the boundaries of that state.” While California considers only some criminal offenses, such as serious felonies, significant enough to share information with ICE; Texas and Florida are more likely to report offenses that may not be as severe, such as minor traffic infractions. Much of ICE’s activity in California was hyper-focused on Greater Los Angeles: About 60% of ICE arrests in the state took place in the seven counties in and around L.A. Even if California is not seeing the largest numbers of arrests, experts say, the dramatic increase in captures stands out from other places because of the lack of official cooperation and public hostility toward immigration agents. Advertisement “A smaller increase in a place that has very little cooperation is, in a way, more significant than seeing an increase in areas that have lots and lots of cooperation,” Kocher said. “The reason is the resistance, organized resistance: the people who literally went to war with them in Paramount, in Compton, in Bell and Huntington Park,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio Los Angeles, an independent political group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps. … We’ve been able, on numerous occasions, to successfully defend the communities and drive them out of our community.” The protests prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines in June, with the stated purpose of protecting federal buildings and personnel. That’s when a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking immigration agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. But on Thursday, the Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the temporary ban on its patrols, arguing that it “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” The order led to a significant drop in arrests across Los Angeles last month. “Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the communities and more work site enforcement,” Homan told reporters two weeks after the court blocked roving patrols. “If they really wanted to scale up and ramp up their deportations,” Ruiz Soto said, “they could go to other places, do it more more safely, more quickly and more efficiently.”

Article: For the past three months, labor unions and business groups have been locked in a protracted fight over a law, approved by the City Council in May, hiking the minimum wage for hotel employees and workers at Los Angeles International Airport to $30 per hour by 2028. Both sides, in an attempt to gain the upper hand, have proposed ballot measures that, if approved, would disrupt the city in enormous ways, leaving an impact that would go well beyond the hourly pay of housekeepers, valets and LAX skycaps. Unite Here Local 11, the politically powerful union that represents hotel and restaurant workers, is looking to put four ballot proposals before voters that, according to critics, would wreak havoc on the city’s economy. Business leaders, in turn, are under fire for filing a ballot petition to repeal the city’s $800 million business tax — a move denounced by city officials, who say it would gut funding for police and other essential services. “We’ve entered this War of the Roses because we don’t have anyone bringing the parties into a room to negotiate a balance that works for everybody, that can help sustain business and address the needs of the workers,” she said. “In the absence of that, everyone is taking matters into their own hands — and that is reckless, sloppy and dangerous.” Los Angeles City Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, pictured in 2020, said the ballot measure battle between organized labor and the business community is getting out of control. and “is in discussion with labor and business groups on a wide range of issues.” “Maybe [Rodriguez] is referring to her own lack of leadership to move her council colleagues towards a legislative outcome,” said Zach Seidl, a Bass spokesperson. City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson was more diplomatic, saying in a brief statement: “People are working hard to figure out solutions, stay tuned.” Advertisement The ballot battle began with little fanfare in May, when a group representing airlines and the hotel industry filed paperwork for a voter referendum on the $30 per hour hotel and airport minimum wage, a few weeks after it was passed by the City Council. Business leaders had argued that the minimum wage hike, along with a healthcare payment that is expected to exceed $8 per hour next year, would trigger layoffs and the closure of restaurants, hotels and airport concessions. Organizers with Unite Here Local 11, who had fought for at least two years to secure the higher wage, responded with their own package of ballot proposals, including a plan to require a citywide election on the development or expansion of large hotels, concert halls, museums, sports facilities, convention center space and — according to city leaders — some 2028 Olympic venues. Manny Morales, an employee at Flying Food Group at LAX, showed up at City Hall in May to demand a boost in the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers. Schaben/Los Angeles Times) Unite Here, which has a history of knocking on doors for its ballot measures and favored candidates, also submitted a voter petition to expand the $30 minimum wage to every worker in L.A. That effort, if approved by voters, would provide financial relief for businesses but also strip more than $800 million from the city budget, or about 10% of the general fund, which pays for police and fire protection. David Green, president of Service Employees International Union Local 721, called the move “irresponsible” and “retaliatory” — and said it would hit a city already reeling from a $1 billion budget shortfall. Advertisement At City Hall, he said, they have been effectively locked out of the conversation for years — and desperately need a way to gain “some sort of leverage” with elected officials. He warned that the plan to force hotels, sports arenas and other projects to go before voters would hurt the city’s ability to carry out “basic economic development.” He predicted that the proposed citywide minimum wage hike would drive businesses and their customers to other parts of Los Angeles County. On top of that, Thornberg said, the proposal targeting exorbitant CEO pay would likely shut down location shoots in L.A., since it would apply to companies seeking film permits on city property. “What they’re doing is clearly living up to that reputation.” Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez, pictured in 2023, is interested in a union proposal to hike the minimum wage of every Angeleno to $30 by 2028. With workers struggling to pay for food and housing and demoralized over President Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, the fight to preserve the $30 per hour tourism minimum wage has received a groundswell of public support at a bleak time, she said. is looking to feel hopeful, to win something, when everything just feels like it’s going to hell.” Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez, who championed the $30 tourism minimum wage, disagreed with the assertion that the ballot measure battle is out of control. He had a dim view of the push to repeal the tourism minimum wage, calling it “despicable.” Airline companies, working alongside the hospitality industry, poured millions of dollars into its signature drive, gathering more than 140,000 signatures within 30 days, he said. Organizers with Unite Here, as well as Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West, which represents LAX employees, led a vigorous campaign to convince voters who regretted signing the petition, saying they had been misled by signature gatherers, to withdraw their names. Unite Here Local 11 co-president Kurt Petersen, pictured at City Hall in 2023, said his union is pressing ahead with ballot proposals to hike the citywide minimum wage, restrict city approval of hotels and crack down on exorbitant CEO pay. Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., said he believes voters will reject those measures, once they learn the effect will be to “force companies to leave L.A.” The proposals from Unite Here’s leaders are less about supporting workers and more about sending a message, Waldman said.

Article: It doesn’t take an awful lot of investigating to see that we’re swimming in an ocean of waste: There are the maxed-out landfills, illegal trash dumping in the desert, choked-up rivers, strangled sea turtles and skyrocketing trash collection fees. By the time 2050 rolls around, “great swaths of California land will have become sacrifice zones contaminated with microplastics and toxic chemicals from uncontrolled dumping of organics with high levels of plastics, synthetic textile and other nonorganic contamination,” said Jan Dell, president and founder of the Laguna Beach-based nonprofit Last Beach Cleanup. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement She noted the rampant dumping that’s already happening in the Antelope Valley, and suggested that even if the state’s landmark plastic legislation is implemented in a way that legislators intended — which includes a requirement that would reduce the amount of single-use plastic sold and distributed in the state — “CalRecycle will never make [it] ... They can’t even effectively ban foam cups.” She and others, including Susan Keefe of Beyond Plastics, another nonprofit, said the plastic and packaging industries have invested too much in ramping up plastic production to allow legislation or bans to stop them. If we continue on the trajectory that we’re on, I don’t see how we’re not going to be swimming in it.” But others, including several waste experts and community organizers across the Los Angeles region, say change is afoot. There are no data or widespread evidence to back up these claims; just hope, determination and a few small-scale examples in which community-organized composting and educational outreach campaigns — with help from groups such as LA Compost and Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE — appeared to have taken hold and made local change. “By 2050 we’ll be in a completely new paradigm,” said Ryan Jackson, executive director of LA Compost — a composting advocacy organization — and former director of the city’s Department of Public Works. It feels dramatic, but from what we’ve seen up close with our organization, it’s very much possible.” Advertisement Jackson sees the shift as one driven organically by neighborhoods and communities that have had an opportunity to see how they could live differently. Members of his organization, which has worked in schools, community gardens and farmers markets from Long Beach to Calabasas, say they’ve witnessed positive shifts in behavior and attitudes when community compost hubs have been established. Chun / Los Angeles Times) “We’re looking at a future [in 2050] where we think the city will be in a much better place because RecycLA will have been in effect for 30 years,” said Victor Sanchez, the executive director of Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE. RecycLA is a 2017 Los Angeles-based recycling program, which — in a public partnership with private waste hauling companies — promotes recycling and requires the diversion of waste material from landfills on an escalating basis. closer to “zero waste” — a plan adopted by the county’s supervisors in 2022, which lays out a framework designed to reduce the use of landfills, maximize the use of natural resources and recover materials for beneficial use or reuse. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 54, which requires that product and packaging manufacturers maintain financial responsibility for their products from beginning to end — theoretically incentivizing companies to produce items that won’t contribute to a glut of waste. Despite these regulatory failures, and an acknowledgment that “capital” and corporate interests have a knack for influencing the implementation of laws and for finding loopholes in legislation — such as the time California banned plastic bags at retail stores, only to discover they’d created an exception for thicker “reusable” plastic bags, and plastic bag waste actually increased — there is reason to hope, said Sanchez. Yes, there have been some short-term failures, he said, but “that’s going to happen when you overhaul an entire system, right?” He said he has seen “beacons of hope” in his work with communities where people are “breathing the air ... Even representatives from the city’s private waste industry are hopeful — despite being on the wrong side of a lawsuit suggesting many of them are delivering unpermitted waste to the Antelope Valley. District Court in Los Angeles by Antelope Valley residents claims that waste-hauling companies including Athens Services and California Waste Services are dumping hazardous substances without authorization, which the companies deny. Athens noted that the law encourages the distribution of compostable material to “farmers and other property owners for beneficial use.” Jessica Aldridge, director of sustainability and zero waste services at Athens Services, an L.A.-based waste hauling company, was not in a position to answer questions about the lawsuit, but said her company is optimistic about what “the environmental community, social justice and waste communities are trying to achieve.” She agreed with Sanchez that while there may be some temporary political and regulatory setbacks, California lawmakers “have a positive goal in mind, and they’re setting up the regulations and the infrastructure” in pursuit of a cleaner environment and a more circular economy. But Keefe, the Beyond Plastics advocate, says all this hope for circular economy laws and small community action is misplaced, that we’re not going to make a dent in waste generation as long as single-use plastic manufacturers produce and sell their products.

The sycamore — now bearing the name El Aliso — appears as a towering black splotch in the first known photo of Los Angeles, shot in the early 1860s when the city was in the process of turning from a Mexican village into an American town. When El Aliso was finally chopped down in 1895, felled by brewery owners who inadvertently killed the giant after cutting off too many limbs and paving over its roots, residents took chips from it as a memento mori of sorts. In 2019, members of the Kizh-Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians were present as representatives from the city of Los Angeles laid a bronze plaque on the sidewalk at the northeast corner of Commercial and Vignes streets — in the shadow of what was then a different strip club — to commemorate El Aliso. “While its physical presence is gone,” the plaque stated, “the oral history handed down through the generations has kept its beauty and story alive in the Kizh people.” Voices Arellano: ‘La migra, la migra’: Inside Huntington Park’s long deportation summer Businesses aren’t open or have signs stating that walk-ins aren’t welcome. But when I finally figured out where the plaque was supposed to be, I found a shallow slot strewn with trash and the remnants of the adhesive that once kept the plaque in its place.

Article: Times readers: “Thinking ahead to 2050, how might you reconfigure the city so it is a sustainable home for everyone?” Here is a sampling of their comments: Use the Chicago riverfront, apartments, architecture, etc., as your example. The roof is made of fireproof TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin), the deck is made with specially treated wood for fire resistance and a fire suppression system in the back of the house sprayed fire retardant onto the vegetation. One estima te is that in the United States, one in four new homes are built in areas prone to wildfires and an estimated 95% of wildfires in California are “man-made.” This existential question has largely been unaddressed in the past 25 years, especially as the region has stuck to its formula of growing communities further outwards. Chun / Los Angeles Times) To transform Los Angeles into a sustainable and equitable city by 2050, we need a holistic approach that addresses climate challenges while fostering community well-being. Adapted housing and support systems will ensure no one lives on the streets, and public spaces will be accessible and inclusive Could AI robots pick up all our trash in the future? Fighting constantly for better public transit is the easy answer as we see Metro working in new projects, but there also has to be a hyper-local push toward smart density, advocating for more walkable neighborhoods, fewer single-family housing developments, and completely redesigning towns and cities so folks can access what they need without needing to drive everywhere. A lot of that is hard, small work you see on a neighborhood scale, but there’s one big project I’d like to see: burying the 101 and building a linear park in the Cahuenga Pass.

Article: Over the last century, Southern California has grown and thrived by accessing water from faraway sources including the Colorado River, the Eastern Sierra’s streams and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. According to state projections, the average amount of water delivered from the Delta to Southern California could decrease by between 13% and 23% within two decades unless measures are taken to ameliorate those declines. Those who lead the region’s large water agencies say they are seeking to line up a diversified mix of sources by recycling wastewater, capturing stormwater, restoring watersheds, possibly building new water-transport infrastructure, and even tapping the Pacific Ocean. “We need to find a way to be sustainable at the same time that water remains affordable,” said Adán Ortega Jr., board chair of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Ortega said the various investments the district is now considering should lay the foundation for a “new and endless river.’’ Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Pure Water Southern California is projected to cost $8 billion and produce up to 150 million gallons of drinking water daily by purifying treated effluent that is now discharged into the ocean. MWD’s plans for the Carson facility call for initially using the recycled water for outdoor irrigation and to recharge groundwater basins, where it would be stored and then pumped out for use. But if we check all those boxes and give ourselves the time to do it, a hundred years from now, people will take it for granted as a source of water.” The need to innovate is evidenced by the recent history of the L.A. A severe shortage of supplies from Northern California in 2022 prompted the Metropolitan Water District to order emergency water restrictions for nearly 7 million people in areas that rely heavily on deliveries from the State Water Project. “People were understandably very upset in terms of the impact on their gardens and landscaping,” said Kristine McCaffrey, general manager of Calleguas Municipal Water District, which delivers water for about 650,000 people in Ventura County. “That’s why we’re working very hard to make sure that we don’t ever encounter this kind of situation again.” The water restrictions were lifted in 2023 when a series of atmospheric river storms brought relief to the state. It is awaiting studies of a company’s proposal to anchor a “farm” of 40-foot-long devices to the ocean floor several miles off the coast of Malibu, which would pump purified freshwater to shore in a pipeline. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) In the next several years, managers of water agencies will study the costs of this and other projects to determine which mix of options will deliver greater reliability while keeping costs in check and preventing steep rate hikes. Lessons from Cape Town Cape Town was particularly vulnerable to the region’s worst drought in centuries because of its heavy reliance on rainwater stored in reservoirs for 98% of its supply, according to Michael Webster, who was the city’s executive director for water and sanitation from 2018 to 2023, and who now works for the World Bank. “The key strategy in overcoming it is to build in some diversification of supply — to groundwater, desalinated water and reused wastewater — in addition to reducing demand.” World & Nation Global Development: How Cape Town found water savings California never dreamed of A six-car municipal police convoy skidded to a halt outside a Cape Town house, and police leaped from their cars at the offending sight: a trickle of hose water splashing onto a squat red flower. Advertisement He said one lesson is to examine future scenarios and rigorously plan around the question of, “What is needed now to avoid a crisis in 10, 20, 30 years’ time?” “In the middle of the Cape Town crisis, you couldn’t build a desal plant. “That a crisis is coming, and it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.” The MWD’s 38-member board of directors recently adopted a blueprint for adapting to climate change. The strategy, part of an effort called the Climate Adaptation Master Plan for Water , assesses potential risks, sets goals for lining up additional water supplies, and outlines criteria for evaluating options. “We can plan within this range of possible needs in the future, and then we can make incremental decisions based on real-world conditions,” said Liz Crosson, MWD’s chief sustainability, resilience and innovation officer. “That really helps prevent us from overbuilding, but it also helps us be super prepared.” Advertisement The plan sets targets including identifying 300,000 acre-feet of additional water supplies per year by 2035 — an amount equivalent to nearly 9% of the region’s average water use over the past decade. A search for new sources There are ongoing public debates over how much to invest in local water sources versus how much to spend on infrastructure to store and transport water from other parts of the state. MWD board members will consider whether to invest in the state’s plan to build Sites Reservoir northwest of Sacramento, and in the Newsom administration’s proposal to build the Delta Conveyance Project (DCP), a water tunnel beneath the Delta with an estimated price tag of $20.1 billion. The proposed Delta tunnel has garnered support from managers of Southern California water agencies, who say it promises to improve the reliability of water deliveries from the State Water Project. Craig Miller, general manager of Western Municipal Water District, says the project “is the backbone of California’s economy” and that investing in modernizing it “ensures we can adapt to a changing climate, protect jobs and the environment, preserve lifestyles, and keep California economically competitive.” Advertisement Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that the project is crucial to the state’s future, and that California‘s existing water system “was designed for a world that no longer exists.” The project is strongly opposed, however, by environmental advocates and the Delta’s political leaders, who say building the 45-mile tunnel would harm the region’s farmlands and communities, and threaten the estuary’s ecosystem and fish species. Christopher Cabaldon (D-West Sacramento) has pointed to the high costs, saying “the real threat here is to the pocketbooks, the monthly water bills, of residents throughout Southern California.” Those who are urging the MWD’s leaders to reject the tunnel plan include Bruce Reznik, executive director of the group Los Angeles Waterkeeper, who says the project would undermine ongoing efforts to prioritize local options. And so things absolutely have to change.” Instead of supporting the tunnel, he said, the region should redouble efforts on conservation and more efficient water use, while investing in recycling wastewater, capturing stormwater and cleaning up contaminated groundwater. Advertisement Supporters of nature-based solutions have called for larger efforts to restore parts of the Los Angeles River’s watershed by removing concrete and asphalt where feasible, reactivating portions of the floodplains that will capture runoff and allow water to percolate underground to replenish the aquifer. These types of projects, intended to restore water’s natural paths in cities, have been called “urban acupuncture” or “sponge cities.” Los Angeles and nearby cities were built on the famous words that William Mulholland, L.A.’s chief water engineer, declared in 1913 as water from the Owens Valley began flowing into a reservoir : “There it is. And it literally does, as it leaps three thousand feet across the Tehachapi Mountains in gigantic siphons to slake the thirst of Los Angeles.” But now, Reznik said, the current realities call for a different sort of water ethic based on becoming resilient through better use of the area’s resources. “Let’s prioritize our investments where they’re going to do the most good, and that’s in resilient local water supplies.” In addition to weighing costs and benefits in dollars, Southern California’s water policymakers are expected to consider the environmental effects of different options, which are often more complicated to assess. For example, diversions of water to supply farms and cities have contributed to the ecological deterioration of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where native fish species have suffered major declines. And because pumping water — including pushing supplies in pipelines up and over the Tehachapi Mountains — is energy intensive, conservation and other local approaches that require less pumping would also help save energy and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. More water-saving potential Researchers at the Pacific Institute, a water think tank in Oakland, have examined the potential for California to use water more efficiently by making improvements such as fixing leaks in pipes, replacing inefficient washing machines and toilets, and replacing thirsty lawns with plants suited to the state’s Mediterranean climate. These potential savings, both inside and outside homes and businesses, far surpass the targets in the MWD’s climate adaptation strategy, said Heather Cooley, the Pacific Institute’s chief research and program officer. She and her colleagues estimated that the South Coast region, which includes MWD’s territory, could save between 1.1 million and 1.7 million acre-feet of water per year by making various efficiency improvements indoors and outdoors. However, they are the cheapest, fastest way to meet our water needs.” As one example, Southern California is expected to save a substantial amount of water in the coming years through a measure state legislators passed in 2023 outlawing the use of drinking water for “nonfunctional” turf — the sort of grass that fills spaces along roads and sidewalks, in front of businesses, and around parking lots. “There is a lot more they can do, and will have to do, as those imported supplies become even more variable and uncertain.” Since 2015, roughly half of Southern California’s water supplies in MWD’s territory have come from imported sources, including Northern California, the Colorado River and the Eastern Sierra, and the remainder has come from local sources including groundwater and recycled water. Anticipating uncertainty The MWD’s climate plan says a key goal is planning for “deep uncertainty.” “We need to be prepared for something that has never been experienced in the period of record, and potentially for several centuries or even millennia,” said John Matthews, executive director and co-founder of the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation. Already, scientists have found that the last 25 years have probably been the driest quarter-century in western North America in 1,200 years, and that climate change is a major contributor. The river’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are now about two-thirds empty, and representatives of California and other states are under pressure to negotiate a deal to take less water from the river. “This is going to be an expensive, multi-decade and complicated process, and it’s going to require really big changes.” He said it’s crucial to remember that Southern California is so highly developed and rich today thanks to the region’s big investments in water in the early 20th century, including the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Colorado River Aqueduct. “They built the state economy around one climate, and now they are moving into a very different kind of climate, and they need to go back and invest into the climate that they’re headed towards,” Matthews said. Advertisement Although federal and state funds in recent years have helped to partially support some water infrastructure projects, such as initial work on the Carson wastewater recycling project, the bulk of the costs are expected to be borne by local agencies and ratepayers. He said the struggles of Mexico City, where water service has recently become intermittent for millions of people , is a scenario that Southern California must plan carefully to avoid.

Article: As Ross received a stream of texts urging her to evacuate, school administrators, calm and collected, repeated the same phrase: “This is the safest place to be.” For many, the idea of hunkering down in a fire shelter for hours on end as flames enclose on all sides is hard to stomach. Fire researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology — a federal science lab tasked with developing science-based standards, including for fire safety — visited Paradise in Northern California 11 times after the 2018 Camp fire and interviewed more than 150 first responders, local officials and residents. Chun/Los Angeles Times) So, in an NIST report published in March , Eric Link and Alexander Maranghides, two NIST fire protection engineers, argue that emergency planners need to face the reality that in these dire evacuation scenarios, they have no choice but to use fire refuges — which means fire experts ought to develop standards for them that are designed to keep people alive. They proposed three types of fire refuges within high-risk communities: Temporary fire refuge areas — parking lots, sports fields or open spaces with good brush clearance — would provide residents with some short-term protection in the worst scenarios but are still not truly safe. To deem a building worthy of “fire shelter” status, it must resist all of fire’s assaults: Its searing radiant heat that extends far beyond the flames, the falling embers capable of sneaking into any cracks to ignite whatever is inside, and the flames themselves. As NIST and other groups accumulate evidence, it’s up to the scientific community to determine when the research is conclusive and create official standards through organizations such as the National Fire Protection Assn. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement One research group looking at satellite data found that wildfires in California are now growing in size four times faster than they were at the start of the century. Meanwhile, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has identified more than 2,200 communities in high fire-risk areas with at least 30 residences and only a single escape route. Without comprehensive guidelines on fire shelters, hospitals, senior living facilities and schools such as Pepperdine have struck deals with their local fire departments: The organizations house people in fire-resistant buildings. The senior director of Pepperdine’s Office of Emergency Services and Office of Insurance and Risk, Jon Weber, said that it’s impossible to guarantee safety with 100% certainty in any scenario, but that the university has gone to exacting lengths to make sheltering at their Malibu campus the safest option for students. In one video , a loud but gentle voice called out: “Please move inward as promptly and calmly as possible, please.” School officials continued to repeat that the library was the safest place to be. The reality was they were in the safest place they could possibly be.” Advertisement An Orange County fire helicopter lifts off with a load of water from a pond at Pepperdine University while fighting the Franklin fire in Malibu on Dec. The protocol got its first real test in the 1993 Old Topanga fire, and subsequently in the Malibu-Calabasas fire in 1996, the Canyon and Corral fires in 2007 and Woolsey in 2018. Ross, like the rest of those who were sheltering, walked out unscathed — though her boyfriend was quick to note she smelled as if she had just smoked 10 cigarettes. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement California has pushed to exclude fire-prone areas from laws designed to fast-track development amid the nation’s housing crisis, and many local governments have made it their official policy to avoid adding any density to fire-prone, hard-to-evacuate areas. Yet for the many communities in the state’s fire-stricken wildlands — from the foothills of the Sierra to Malibu’s coastal canyons — building new fire shelters may be essential to survival.

Article: When the fires this year upended Los Angeles and put into question what it even means to return to normal, I was reminded of a chapter in “California Against the Sea” that had expanded my own understanding of what it takes to truly adapt our built environment — and to reimagine the places that we have come to love and call home. This chapter, which opens with a radical shoreline reconfiguration just north of San Francisco, came not without controversy, but it provided a glimpse into what compromise might need to look like for so many communities struggling to keep up with climate change. Here along the foggy bluffs of the Sonoma coast, the edge of the continent feels more like the edge of the world — a window into the future if California does not change course. These wave-cut cliffs, a brittle mélange of ancient claystone and shale, have been eroding on average about a foot a year, exacerbated since the 1980s by a hardened shoreline, intensifying El Niños and, now, sea level rise. (Carolyn Cole/ Los Angeles Times) So, with every storm and every knock from the ocean, officials have scrambled to save the highway, pouring millions of tax dollars into a vicious cycle of sudden collapses and emergency repairs. Advertisement “This is what unmanaged retreat looks like, and it is quite frankly a hot mess of septic systems, old house parts and armoring that have fallen into the intertidal zone with no real mechanism for cleaning it up,” Sonoma County supervisor Lynda Hopkins declared. “If we don’t start planning ahead and taking proactive measures, Mother Nature will make the decisions for us.” With the realities of climate change looming ever closer, California transportation officials agreed it was time to try something different: make peace with the sea and move the crumbling highway more than 350 feet inland. They knew nailing down the details would be fraught, but, if done right, this would be the first radical effort by the state to plan for a reimagined coast — a coast that could support California into the next century. It was the rare managed retreat proposal that intentionally sought to both raise and relocate critical infrastructure far enough from the shore to make room for the next 100 years of rising water. Officials studied more than 20 alternatives that tried to balance safety codes, traffic needs, fragile habitats, public access to the coast and other competing requirements that were tricky to meet given the topography. At its heart this project, like so many attempts along the California coast, called for a reckoning over what was worth saving — and what was worth sacrificing — and whether it was possible to redesign a treasured landscape so that it survives into the future. Book cover for “California Against the Sea” by Rosanna Xia (Heyday Books) “It seems daunting; it’s a lot of change to cope with, but it’s also an opportunity for communities to think about, ‘What are the coastal resources we want to have access to fifty, one hundred years from now?’” said Tami Grove, who oversees transportation projects for the California Coastal Commission and spent years reconciling all the emotional meetings, the disagreements, the many stops and stalls and hand-wringing compromises. “It gets lost, sometimes, when people are worried about everything that we’re going to lose to sea level rise — but there are things that we’re going to be able to choose and enhance and design into the future if we start planning now.” In what many described as a major coup in government bureaucracy, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the coastal commission and county leaders set aside their differences to come up with a new solution together. By November 2020, they had hammered out a plan to relocate almost one mile of the highway — most notably with a new 850-foot-long bridge spanning Scotty Creek, a degraded stream that, choked for decades by the highway’s current configuration, rarely reached the ocean anymore. The concrete bridge (a monstrous overpass or a reasonable compromise, depending on who’s talking) will at least allow Scotty Creek to flow freely into the ocean again — making room for more red-legged frogs, Myrtle’s silverspot butterflies, and the passage of steelhead trout and coho salmon. This all came as a shock at first for Philip and Roberta Ballard, who own and live on the ranch, but they said they’ve come to understand the necessity of this project. The bridge still feels way too big — especially for this rural stretch of paradise that first captured their hearts more than two decades ago — but after years of meetings, questions and debating each trade-off, the retired couple decided to turn their energies toward making sure Scotty Creek got restored as part of the deal. “We’ve arrived at feeling reasonably good about getting the best mitigation we can get for this region and getting something reasonably positive out of it.” Construction crews work on building a new bridge over Scotty Creek, as part of Caltrans’ Gleason Beach Roadway Realignment Project. (John Huseby / Caltrans) When we don’t understand and don’t allow for the ocean’s ways, we end up with homes perched on crumbling cliffs and seawalls still making a stand. Guided by a few mere decades of history and a narrow understanding of the California shore, many today know only how to preserve the version of the coast they learned to love. Advertisement Stefan Galvez-Abadia, Caltrans’s district division chief of environmental planning and engineering, is now attempting with his team to design a prettier bridge at Gleason Beach, one more fitting for the rural landscape. They’ve conducted surveys on what color to paint the bridge — some shade of gray or brown, for example, or a more distinct hue like that of the Golden Gate Bridge. Donne Brownsey, who served as vice chair of the Coastal Commission at the time, remarked that the project reminded her of a concrete beam bridge in Mendocino County that spans the mouth of the Ten Mile River, just north of where she lives in Fort Bragg. “It was a new bridge, it caused a lot of consternation, but I didn’t know that the first few times I went over it — I would look forward to that part of the drive, because I could see the whole estuary to the west, and I could see the rivershed to the east,” she said. “You don’t even really see the bridge anymore because the swallows now all nest there, and it’s just part of nature.” The bridge at Gleason Beach, facing similar design constraints as the Ten Mile Bridge, also has to be massive — a counter-intuitive twist to what one might think it means to accommodate the environment. Engineers had at first tried more minimal options — a shorter bridge, thinner columns, a less intrusive height — but many were not large enough in size or distance to outlast the coastal erosion projected for the next 100 years. (Caltrans) Despite so many years of seminars and talks about climate change adaptation, turning an abstract concept like managed retreat into reality has been a delicate exercise in compromise, Galvez-Abadia said. These are the difficult decisions that we will all have to make as a region, as a community, for generations to come.” As he filed away his notes and prepared to break ground, he reflected once more on all the years it took to reach this first milestone. If the native plants reemerge, the salmon return, and there still remains a coast that families could safely access and enjoy, perhaps this new highway — however bold, however different — could show California that it is possible, that it isn’t absurd, to build toward a future where nature and modern human needs could finally coexist.

Article: The Los Angeles we know has long been an irresistible subject for novelists and moviemakers — so much so that they’ve often tortured reality to make it conform to their imagination. Robert Towne mined the history of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in his screenplay for “Chinatown” but moved the story ahead up by some two decades, from 1913 to the 1930s, to give his scenario its noir sensibility. Ridley Scott and his filmmaking team depicted a future Los Angeles beset with darkness and a never-ending downpour of rain for “Blade Runner” — never mind that its source material, Philip K. The tone of nonfiction conjectures about the future of Los Angeles generally fall into two categories, elegiac or apocalyptic — and sometimes both: “utopia or dystopia,” in the words of Davis. It was his follow-up, “Ecology of Fear” (1998), that really attempted to sketch out a future for the city, based on his vision of “the great unbroken plains of aging bungalows, stucco apartments, and ranch-style homes — as it erodes socially and physically into the twenty-first century.” Davis drew a line from what he saw as “the current obsession with personal safety and social insulation ... in the face of intractable urban poverty and homelessness, and despite one of the greatest expansions in American business history” in the mid-1990s to explain “why fear eats the soul of Los Angeles.” Mike Davis in his San Diego home in 2022.

The Slovenian transplant Louis Adamic, who had emigrated to the United States in 1913 and settled in the port community of San Pedro, scrutinized Southern California with pitiless objectivity in a 1930 essay titled “Los Angeles! There she blows!” Culture Monster Blog Reading L.A.: Louis Adamic and Morrow Mayo This article was originally on a blog post platform and may be missing photos, graphics or links. Adamic mentioned the conviction among Angelenos that their city “will ultimately — perhaps within the next three or four decades — be the biggest city in the world.” And he acknowledged that “the place has many great advantages, among the foremost, of course, being Climate, and but a single drawback, which, however, is an extremely serious one — that of water shortage.” Nevertheless, noting that the city’s population had doubled over the previous 10 years to nearly 2 million, he confidently predicted that it would number 3 million by 1935. Another writer who extrapolated from what he saw of the Los Angeles of his time was Morrow Mayo, whose 1933 book “Los Angeles” is quoted elsewhere in The Times’ Future of L.A. Mayo expressed the opinion that even if “the territory known as the ‘City of Los Angeles’” grew from its then-population of 1.2 million to 4 million or more, he doubted that “it will ever be permanently the great vibrant, vital, nerve-center of the Pacific coast.” Advertisement The reason, Mayo wrote, was its climate — “meant for slow-pulsing life; a climate where man, when he gets adjusted to the environment, takes his siesta in the middle of the day. Carey McWilliams wrote that the aircraft industry was “likely to remain in the region and even to expand production,” but Boeing’s military aircraft assembly line was shut down in 2015, ending an era. After a few generations under the sun, Mayo concluded, “it will settle back to normalcy, and become in tune with nature, for man has never yet failed to adjust himself to the climate in which he lives.” Thus did Mayo pioneer the stereotype of the laid-back Angeleno with barely a care in the world. On the other hand, Mayo quoted a fellow prognosticator as finding in the city’s industrial districts “that same peculiarly contented type of workman, the same love of little homes ‘across the street from the factory,’ the diligence and care for the flowers in the front yard, or the fruit trees and vegetables in the rear, a total lack of the Bohemian spirit, the love of a comfortable, humble existence,” that could be seen in Philadelphia. ‘Los Angeles — the Philadelphia of the West.’” Advertisement Such miscalculations point to another pitfall facing those who would dare to predict the future of Los Angeles: Change has come so rapidly that any prediction can be confounded within the lifetime of its author. Thus Carey McWilliams, that indefatigable chronicler of the California pageant, wrote in his book “Southern California Country: An Island on the Land” that the aircraft industry was “likely to remain in the region and even to expand production.” McWillliams wrote those words in 1946; by 1980, when he died, the industry had crashed in Southern California, entering a long period of retrenchment that ended with Boeing’s closing of the region’s last commercial aircraft manufacturing plant in 2005. The Long Beach plant’s 300 workers were transferred to Boeing’s military aircraft assembly line, but that was shut down in 2015, ending an era, as The Times observed, in which the region was. “once synonymous with the manufacture of aircraft.” The trajectory of the Los Angeles ecology, and by extension that of Southern California and the entire state of California, was the subject of Reisner’s 1986 book, “Cadillac Desert.” He viewed the water politics of the region, quite properly, through the prism of winner-take-all economics. Department of Water and Power) “The West’s real crisis is one of inertia, of will, and of myth,” he wrote in the closing pages of “Cadillac Desert.” Reisner looked ahead, hopefully, to a West that “might import a lot more meat and dairy products from states where they are raised on rain, rather than dream of importing those states’ rain .... A region where people begin to recognize that water left in rivers can be worth a lot more — in revenues, in jobs — than water taken out of the rivers.” “At some point, perhaps within my lifetime, the American West will go back to the future than forward to the past.” Advertisement Regrettably, Reisner, who died in 2000, didn’t live to see that happen. In his 1998 book “Paradise Lost,” Schrag sought not simply to foretell the region’s future, but to explicate how its future foretold what was in store for the country as a whole. it is at the forefront of the world’s leading-edge technologies and of its creative energy.” (He was right about that, at least up to this moment.) Surfers enjoy a day at Venice Beach. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times) But Schrag also pointed to the state’s “increasingly dysfunctional governmental and fiscal public institutions, the depleted state of its public infrastructure, services, and amenities, the growing gaps between its affluent and its poorer residents, and its pinched social ethos,” which “hang like dark clouds in the sunny skies.” California had exported to other states the facile low-tax policies of Howard Jarvis and Ronald Reagan’s view of government as “the problem, not the solution.” Advertisement In addition, Schrag saw that the emergence of social media “may insure against the power of Big Brother to dominate communications, but they also amplify the power of shared ignorance .... What used to be limited to gossip over the back fence is now spread in milliseconds.” And he foresaw how the changing demographics of California would be replicated nationwide: “The new kids now crowding into the schools and universities of California — black, brown, Asian — will constitute the majority of the state’s workforce, and a good part of the nation’s, in the next decade, and forever after,” he wrote. Schrag had his finger on an essential truth about Los Angeles and California that remains true to this day: They’re the subject of unending curiosity for readers of history and current affairs no less than for consumers of novels and movies. Kevin Starr wrote: “In recent times, the American people have turned to California and asked it to create a technology revolution, and California responded.” (Bloomberg via Getty Images) Kevin Starr, writing in 1995, understood how that impulse would play out in the decades to come. “The United States is testing its future through California,” he said in an essay for the website of the California State Library, which he served as state librarian from 1994 to 2004. The American people have turned to California for new models of lifestyle, new ways of enjoying and celebrating the gift of life, and California responded with an outpouring of architecture, landscaping, entertainment, sport and recreation.” The confidence that Starr projected 20 years ago may have faded, and may fade further in the future in Los Angeles and up and down the state.

Article: Visitors made shadow puppets for AI to identify, used AI to generate songs, asked chatbots questions and faced off with AI in a game in which players tried to draw images that only humans would recognize. “It sort of breaks down those guardrails, those big walls that people have put up around AI, and allows them to have a conversation with somebody else,” said Doug Thistlewolf, who manages exhibit development at the Exploratorium. For years, Silicon Valley has been at the center of innovation with some of the world’s valuable tech companies such as Meta, Google, Apple and Nvidia locating their massive headquarters south of San Francisco. But the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT — a chatbot that can generate text, images and code — set off a fierce race to propel technology that touches industries from media to healthcare. Advertisement In the first half of 2025, venture capital funding for AI companies in the San Francisco Metro area surpassed $29 billion — more than double the amount during the same period in 2022, data from PitchBook shows. Ask ChatGPT what SF will look like in 10 years and it generates an image of the city’s skyline with futuristic architecture and flying saucers next to the Golden Gate Bridge. AI has been a “bright spot” in the city’s economy, helping San Francisco to recover after retailers, office workers and some companies such as X (formerly Twitter) left the downtown area during and after the pandemic as remote work picked up. “The economic impact is [AI companies] take more office space, they pay more taxes, they hire more people,” said Ted Egan, chief economist of the city and county of San Francisco. Over the past five years, AI-related companies have leased more than 5 million square feet of San Francisco office space and the amount is projected to grow, according to CBRE, a real estate service and investment firm. The city’s office vacancy rate of 35.8% in the first quarter would be cut in half if these companies take up 16 million square feet of office space by 2030. Advertisement San Francisco resident Vijay Karunamurthy has seen the city’s boom and bust cycles unfold over the last 25 years while working at startups and tech giants such as Google and Apple. In 2000, when he moved from Chicago to San Francisco for an engineering job at a data startup, he saw major business such as Pets.com collapse during the dot-com crash. “That amount of energy being concentrated in San Francisco has just been huge for the city,” said Karunamurthy, 46, the former field chief technology officer at Scale AI, a data-labeling startup. “It means every single night there’s AI events, and if you go to a coffee shop, you’ll run into people working on AI.” Still, there are plenty of AI skeptics. In late July, outside of OpenAI’s headquarters in Mission Bay, a small group of protesters including a person dressed up as a robot held up signs that said “AI will kill us all” and “AI steals your work to steal your jobs.” Children interact with the “Giant Mirror” at the Exploratorium’s “Adventures in AI” exhibition in Downtown San Francisco on Thursday. Arno Puder, professor and chair of San Francisco State University’s computer science department, said generative AI represents a historic “paradigm shift.” The longtime San Francisco resident is equally excited, but also a little scared, about how it will affect labor. “That does make me worry a little bit, but if you ask me for a prediction on what services or what the world’s going to look like in a few years from now, I don’t know.” AI’s rise has inspired the creation of new spaces throughout San Francisco where people can discuss technology’s benefits and risks. Backed by Anthropic, the San Francisco company that developed the AI chatbot Claude, the exhibit aims to educate people about AI but doesn’t shy away from the debate surrounding technology. “Maybe there would be more money also for housing being built.” Throughout the city, AI startups are broadcasting their mission loudly on billboards and ads displayed at bus stops and train stations. Don’t replace them.” Founded in downtown San Francisco in 2022, Outset created an AI interviewer so researchers could quickly gather feedback from more people to better understand customer needs and improve products. The company’s 36-year-old chief executive, Aaron Cannon, said before the rise of ChatGPT, he and his co-founder experimented with AI systems that can generate and understand human language and saw its potential. He declined to disclose its finances but said the company, which employs 15 and counts Microsoft among its clients, is “growing fast.” Throughout San Francisco, founders and real estate companies have dubbed certain areas as AI hubs. (Florence Middleton/For The Times) Hayes Valley, a neighborhood with Victorian houses, boutique shops and trendy restaurants, bears the nickname “Cerebral Valley,” a nod to the hacker houses and AI communities that popped up in the area. Located near public transportation, water and greenery, the fresh air and serene nature of the area has attracted AI entrepreneurs that want to collaborate in person, said Michael Phillips, principal and chairman of Jamestown.

Article: The Los Angeles City Council has given final approval to a sweeping rezoning plan to meet state-mandated housing goals, clearing the path for an additional 255,000 homes to be built. But some observers believe that by 2050, the fate of L.A.’s housing stock will be decided by one of two competing ideologies: One of them is associated with many corporate landlords and investment firms, which buy up increasing shares of homes and rent them out to tenants. “The answer is to increase density, upzone areas and allow multifamily housing.” Advertisement But he doesn’t see the battle between the state and local governments (and HOAs that hope to keep things the way they are) ending any time soon. (Raul Roa / Los Angeles Times) Sacramento has a few tools at its disposal, including what is colloquially known as builder’s remedy, a penalty for cities that don’t adequately plan for California’s inevitable population increase. A drone shot shows a two-story ADU, which rests an inch from a 1920s bungalow and five feet from a 1990s duplex and a few feet from a dingbat apartment to the south. housing may very well be Senate Bill 9 , which makes it easier for California homeowners and developers to add density by splitting single-family lots in half and building duplexes, townhouses and ADUs. Thanks to a handful of bills that make ADUs easier and faster to build, Prang said ADU applications have skyrocketed since the law passed in 2021, and his office spends around 40% of its time processing them. But Prang said by 2050, he expects there to be a single portal that consolidates all the applications and checkpoints required, so new developments can be green-lit in weeks or months, not years. The measure, which took affect in 2023 and brings a transfer tax to property sales above $5 million, has already raised more than $660 million for housing and homelessness initiatives. A recent analysis from UCLA’s Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies — titled “The Unintended Consequences of Measure ULA” — suggests the tax has chilled a once-robust market in L.A., while sales above $5 million have remained steady in other markets across L.A. But by 2050, Measure ULA will likely have raised tens of billions of dollars — an unprecedented amount of cash that, if used effectively, has the potential to solve many of the cities housing woes. “We’ll use those funds to bring housing to market faster and look at creative models for home-ownership — things we haven’t been able to do for lack of funding,” said Johnson Hall, whose Housing Department oversees Measure ULA. “Our economy is dependent on giving those 20- to 30-somethings a reason to stay here.” Real estate agent Christopher Stanley is all too familiar with L.A.’s grueling application process for building, rebuilding, or even remodeling. Stanley said there’s plenty of demand for it, since the price-per-square-foot typically runs about 25% less than single-family properties, but the lengthy permitting process makes it unattractive for many developers. By 2050, Stanley said AI could make the permitting process so quick and painless that not only house-flippers and developers, but also individual homeowners, could add density to their neighborhoods. “But changing the laws will be crucial.” For Stanley, the biggest boost would come if more cities allow ADUs to be sold as separate properties, not just rented — a trend that has already caught on up the coast in Oregon and Washington. Advertisement Combine that with their inability to afford a home in the first place, and we’ll soon see the rise of co-buying: Groups of friends going in on a Silver Lake bungalow. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) “In Los Angeles, our parks include everything from neighborhood recreation centers and open spaces to theaters, beaches, lakes, aquariums, equestrian centers, golf courses, historic homes and gardens. They are the shared treasures of our community,” said Lindsey Kozberg, executive director of the Los Angeles Parks Foundation, a nonprofit that formed in 2008 as a response to budget cuts to park programs during the recession. If the trend continues, by 2050, it’ll likely require a mix of philanthropic funding and community partnerships to make sure every Angeleno has a safe and accessible park to visit. Jordan Lang, president of McCourt Partners, said gathering places have become so much more important in the age of the internet, and investing in them is vital to the growth of the city. Lang serves as president of Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies, the limited liability company behind the controversial proposed gondola system that would take baseball fans from Union Station to Dodger Stadium. “This is a test case of what we can do in L.A.,” Lang said, adding that it would also serve nearby Elysian Park, getting people out of their cars and into green spaces.

Article: “On the contrary, it is, and has been since 1888, a commodity; something to be advertised and sold to the people of the United States like automobiles, cigarettes and mouth wash. Mayo’s acerbic book “Los Angeles” appeared in 1933, when the city was in its second decade as the dominant metropolis of California; in the 1920 census, its population had finally exceeded that of San Francisco, which had been the center of the state’s economic and political life since the Gold Rush and the granting of statehood. Los Angeles lies nestled within a vast basin stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountain ranges on the north and northwest, some 3½ million acres of mostly undeveloped territory capable, in the fullness of time, of supporting a population of more than 13 million. The best natural harbor in Southern California is San Diego’s, and the nearest shore is a 30-mile trek from the pueblo that the Spaniards of Mexico established as their civic seat early in the 19th century. Its rivers are dry gulches for most of the year; Mark Twain is said to have quipped that he once fell into a Southern California river and “come out all dusty.” The Los Angeles that became the queen city of California did not grow naturally, but had to be “conjured into existence.” Almost everything that made it habitable needed to be imported. Its water came from a river valley 200 miles away and its electricity from a river canyon 300 miles to the east, brought to the city via systems that are titanic marvels of human engineering. In 1850, while San Francisco was basking in the stupendous influx of people and wealth produced by the Gold Rush, Los Angeles was still barely a village, with 1,610 inhabitants recorded in the 1850 census and “no newspaper, hospital, public school, college, library, Protestant church, factory, bank, or public utility of any kind.” One-third of its residents could neither read nor write. Beef prices were driven so high by the surge in demand that Mexican ranchers flooded the market with livestock, eroding what had been a Southern California monopoly; by 1855, the competition had sent prices plummeting by 75%. Yet another drought arrived in 1863, killing cattle by the tens of thousands; for years to come travelers in the south would be “often startled by coming suddenly on a veritable Golgotha, a place of skulls, the long horns standing out in defiant attitude, as if protecting the fleshless bones.” Pitching the Southern California dream The promotion of Southern California’s Mediterranean climate took hold in the first decade after the Gold Rush and continued into the new century. “The diseases of children prevalent elsewhere are unknown here,” reported Charles Dudley Warner, the co-author with Mark Twain of the 1873 novel “The Gilded Age.” “They cut their teeth without risk, and cholera infantum never visits them. These facts are derived from medical practice.” A “Winter in California” postcard postmarked 1905 from the collection of Patt Morrison draws a sharp contrast between East and West Coast winters. Truman, an East Coast transplant, compiled the death rates from all causes in American cities for his 1885 book “Homes and Happiness in the Golden State of California” and found 37 deaths per thousand inhabitants in New Orleans; 24 in St. “From such diseases many of the towns of California are remarkably free.” The German-born journalist Charles Nordhoff wrote glowingly of the regional climate’s health-giving qualities for tuberculosis patients, describing it as the French Riviera’s equal, lacking only the deluxe hospitality infrastructure of that renowned gathering place of the rich: “You will not find ... Nature has done much; man has not, so far, helped her.” If he was trying to alert resort developers to the existence of a blank slate to be written on for great profit, he could hardly have done better A place to start anew In 1887, some 120,000 passengers were brought into Los Angeles by the Southern Pacific railroad, while the Santa Fe served the region with as many as four passenger trains a day. Los Angeles “suddenly changed from a very old city to a very young one.” In 1890, more than three-fourths of its residents had lived in the city for fewer than four years. a crowd of speculators settled down upon Los Angeles like flies upon a bowl of sugar.” The railroads brought swarms of sharp operators who had already drained the Midwest of its potential for land fraud and detected on the West Coast a “golden opportunity of the fakir and humbug and the man with the past that he wanted forgotten,” a municipal historian wrote. Promoters established new townsites on every patch of vacant land, building hotels and laying down concrete sidewalks and community halls: “A miniature city appeared, like a scene conjured up by Aladdin’s lamp, where a few months ago the jack-rabbit sported and the coyote howled,” Brook wrote. Nearly 1.5 million new residents moved into Southern California between 1920 and 1930, an influx that was labeled “the largest internal migration in the history of the American people,” and one that would not be exceeded until the postwar 1940s and 1950s.

Article: A writer learns to embrace her imperfect recovery from an eating disorder GeorgePeters/Digital Vision Vectors/Getty Images When Mallary Tenore Tarpley was 11 years old, her mother died from breast cancer. Sponsor Message "I found that calorie counts gave me some semblance of control in the aftermath of my mother's death; I couldn't control what happened to her body, but I could regulate what I put in mine," she writes. In her new book, SLIP: Life in the Middle of Eating Disorder Recovery, which combines memoir and research, Tarpley, now 40, writes about living with an eating disorder and the insights she's gained as an adult. Instead of the low-fat foods and heroin-chic of the 1990s, everyone seems to be using GLP-1s and #skinnytok, a social media hashtag promoting eating disorders, had millions of views before it was banned by TikTok in June. In her book, she writes about living in this "middle place." She examines how shifting from an all-or-nothing recovery approach of her teens and early 20s to one where setbacks are expected and accepted has allowed her to live a full life while continuing to strive for progress. Then [as a journalist], I started to do some work around restorative narratives, which is this genre that is really looking at how people in communities make meaningful pathways forward in the aftermath of trauma and illness. Around this time I was also meeting my now husband and was beginning to realize that if I want to be in a meaningful relationship with him, it would have to be rooted in honesty. So many of the people I interviewed [for the book] said that they inhabit this [middle] place, and that to be able to own that narrative and to give words to it was really helpful. There are moments when I feel like there's a little bit of a fake-it-till-you-make-it situation where I will talk with my kids about their bodies, and I will be thinking negatively about my own. I'm talking with them about how strong they are, and how their bodies help them move through the world, and how I want them to feel like they can take up space in the world, and yet I find that I still have trouble doing that myself.

Article: European nations have rallied behind Ukraine, emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without Kyiv's involvement KYIV, Ukraine -- European nations rallied behind Ukraine, saying peace in the war-torn nation can’t be resolved without Kyiv, ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. Zelenskyy responded by thanking European allies and wrote on X on Sunday: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people." Saturday's statement by top European leaders came after the White House confirmed the U.S president was willing to grant Putin the one-on-one meeting Russia has long pushed for, and suggestions from Trump that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories," raising fears Kyiv may be pressured into giving up land or accepting other curbs on its sovereignty. A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they aren’t allowed to speak publicly, told The Associated Press that Trump remained open to a trilateral summit with both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, but for now, he will have a bilateral meeting requested by Putin. The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there’s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. Saturday's statement, signed by the president of the European Union and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the UK, stressed the need for a “just and lasting peace” for Kyiv, including “robust and credible” security guarantees. A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. Trump had also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Ukrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine’s inability to regain lost territories militarily.

Article: “The theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,” said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool. “There’s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments — especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.” Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% — while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. “I think up until now, you’ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.” Employers would have to decide to offer the plans — and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there’s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. “Without proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.” Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses. “So that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.” Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers. “Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.” He continued: “Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments — appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules — could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.” Experts believe it could take months to see any changes.

Article: Johner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images Investors may soon have greater access to private assets — that is, investments that are not publicly traded — in their 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a "prudent investment mix" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan. Defined-contribution workplace plans — which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others — held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. "Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets," Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email. "If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are," said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it." The law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries. "It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid," Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst for TD Cowen, wrote in a policy note on July 16. Private assets may be slow to 'gain traction' Private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR have introduced new products to make inroads into defined contribution plans.

Article: Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic who once described Covid-19 shots as “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” announced on Tuesday that he is terminating nearly $500 million in federal contracts supporting the development of next-generation vaccines and other treatments based on mRNA technology. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses,” he said in a video posted online. You can’t explain the evolution from Trump’s first administration, which fast-tracked the development of mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 through Operation Warp Speed, to the second term’s anti-vax, “Make America Healthy Again” schtick without talking about the network’s role in turning the GOP base against vaccines and toward conspiracy theorists like Kennedy. When pharmaceutical companies began rolling out the vaccines produced under the Trump administration in late 2020 and early 2021, Fox News’ stars could have used the unique influence they have over their viewers to encourage them to get their Covid-19 shots. But Trump had lost his re-election bid, and the network that had worked so hard to keep him in office instead pandered to anti-vaxxers by turning against the vaccination campaign helmed by his successor, President Joe Biden. Led by its then-prime-time star Tucker Carlson, the network incessantly promoted misleading and false claims about safe, effective vaccines with the potential to save their viewers’ lives — day after day, month after month, year after year. Fox News continued to broadcast these segments even as more Republican parts of the country, with lower vaccination rates, suffered higher Covid-19 death tolls, as The New York Times’ David Leonhardt detailed. Before the pandemic, Kennedy, the scion of a Democratic dynasty who once called for a boycott of Fox News host Sean Hannity and described him as a fascist, was not a natural fit for the Fox audience. But with the Covid-19 vaccine campaign underway, his decades of work undermining vaccines and his attacks on the new mRNA vaccines in particular suddenly made him attractive to the right. All of the fawning attention on Kennedy from the right — alongside mainstream news coverage of his bizarre history, such as his claim that a parasite in his brain had triggered memory loss — had the impact one would expect: Kennedy became more popular with Republicans than Democrats. As Kennedy’s nomination moved through the Senate, they touted him as a “reformer” and “true health care crusader” who had “the skills, knowledge, and experience” needed for the job.” When Kennedy said he wasn’t going to take away anyone’s vaccines, Fox said he wasn’t going to take away anyone’s vaccines.

ICE officials told The Wall Street Journal that in mid-May the White House ordered them to stop “develop[ing] target lists of immigrants” and just “go out on the streets” and make arrests right away. Deportation czar Tom Homan told Fox News that agents will detain people “based on the location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions like … they walk away.” DHS describes these interactions as “consensual.” But they are anything but. As a California district court put it, “When individuals have tried to avoid an encounter with agents and officers, they have been followed and pushed to the ground, sometimes even beaten, and then taken away.” Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week. In one case, DHS agents pepper-sprayed, tackled and brutally beat a landscaper in Los Angeles after they profiled him outside an IHOP, and — according to DHS — he “refused to answer questions” and tried to leave. In another case, agents jumped from a car to arrest a random Latino man on the street who asserted in English, “I have the right to remain silent.” The one thing that the DHS data does not record: how many times DHS illegally profiles U.S. After they learned she was a citizen, they charged her with impeding their efforts to chase down other people to determine “whether they were lawfully present.” In other words, their defense against charges of illegal profiling was: We were profiling someone else! The appeals court reaffirmed prior rulings that have found it is unconstitutional to stop or detain people based on broad characteristics that would “cast suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.” It said this included not just race, but also language ability, occupation and location, such as Home Depot. Not only that, under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration agents don’t even have the authority to interrogate someone without a warrant or reason to believe that the person is a noncitizen.

One Jane Doe, speaking in court in 2019, testified that she and the other victims “will always carry irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives after this.” Victims typically enter exploitation during critical stages of their physical, emotional and cognitive development.

Article: Many of President Donald Trump's picks to be federal judges have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions Trump has said abortion is a state issue. As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations “are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.” "It’s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,” she said. “The Democrats’ extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump’s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.” Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” — Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution’s protections for religious freedom. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a “barbaric practice” and “one of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable” in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. — Joshua Divine, a deputy solicitor general of Missouri who is nominated to be a district judge in the state, is currently representing Missouri in a case challenging the FDA approval of mifepristone. Divine co-authored the lawsuit, which includes misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb.” In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a “zealot" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as “the killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being” and argued that life begins at fertilization. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion. Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life, said she was hopeful the administration will continue nominating those “who will respect the rule of law.” Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time. Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said the courts, until now, have largely been an effective option for advocates to challenge state abortion bans and restrictions. “This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion — saying he’s going to leave it to the states while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," she said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House. In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” One from Missouri spread misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb” in a lawsuit aiming to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Article: Tube staff face deportation under new visa rules 5 hours ago Share Save Kumail Jaffer Local Democracy Reporting Service Share Save PA Media Scores of Transport for London staff are facing deportation because of new immigration rules Scores of foreign Transport for London (TfL) staff could be deported because of rule changes which mean they no longer qualify for visa sponsorship. More than 60 employees who came to the UK on skilled worker visas may have to leave because salary thresholds have gone up and key transport roles have been taken off the eligible list. It added: "Under this approach, every sector will be required to implement a workforce strategy focused on training British workers, or risk losing access to the immigration system, as part of wider efforts to reinforce the integrity of the points-based system and end dependence on lower-skilled international recruitment." TfL is obliged to comply with the changes, which took effect on 22 July and will remain until at least the end of 2026. "Now the new government rules risk shattering these workers' lives and leaving gaps in employment for London Underground." The Home Office has been urged to reverse the "unfair and short-sighted" changes According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, an anonymous at-risk employee said they just wanted a fair chance to work and loved their job. It was like a nuclear bomb going off in our household." The leader of London Assembly's Liberal Democrat group, Hina Bokhari, said: "Deporting vital Tube staff because of sudden last-minute rule changes is unfair and short-sighted. "London relies on the skills and commitment of these people." Green Party Assembly member Caroline Russell said: "The government should withdraw these cruel changes that are going to ruin lives by sending away the workers London depends upon."

Article: The NFL announced a deal with ESPN this week that differs significantly from how the league and one of its most important broadcast partners have always done business with each other. Instead of the traditional exchange in which ESPN hands the NFL a pile of cash for the rights to air a slate of Monday Night Football games (and some other games), this deal marries the two entities together as equity partners. The NFL will now own a 10% slice of ESPN, and the country’s biggest sports network will take over some of the league’s media properties, including the NFL Network and the Red Zone Channel, which gives live updates from every game when teams are close to scoring a touchdown. “So what if I told you,” to borrow the language that ESPN used to promote its 30 for 30 series, that the league’s biggest TV deal yet could be the catalyst for a decline in football’s popularity similar to what boxing experienced after it reached a high mark in the late ‘80s and ‘90s? The league’s 32 teams shared a record $13.8 billion in national revenues last season, prompting a rise in the NFL salary cap that in the offseason led to record contracts for players like Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns and his rival, edge rusher TJ Watt of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Selling a stake in the network to the most powerful of those partners is aimed at helping ESPN, whose parent company, The Walt Disney Co., just announced a consolidation of its streaming services when it launches its own $30/month streaming service this month. When the NFL launched its popular Sunday Ticket service in 1994, it did so through one partner, DirecTV, which carried every regular season game and charged consumers between $99 and $139 a season for the full package. Fifteen Thursday Night Football games now stream exclusively on Amazon’s Prime Video platform, which costs money to access, and two Christmas Day contests will play on Netflix, which also costs money to access. That day could be far off, given that the league’s deal with YouTube runs though the 2029 season, but it’s likely executives have thought about unconventional ways of selling the games to consumers. Former ESPN president John Skipper, who left the network in 2017, argued on a 2023 podcast that “the single best way I can think of for the NFL to increase their annual revenue take for their clubs, is to make the Super Bowl a Pay-Per-View event.” He suggested that the NFL could charge viewers up to $250 to watch the Super Bowl. Several factors contributed to the sport’s decline, but one of the reasons was that, beginning in the 1980s, the promoters who ran the sport largely eschewed a free broadcast audience in favor of major pay-per-view events. The irony here is that the Saudi boxing promoter Turki Alalshikh, currently considered the most innovative promoter in the sport, recently announced a partnership with the streamer DAZN under which none of his future fights will be oﬀered on a pay-per-view basis.

Earlier that day, she was asked on national television why Republican President Donald Trump had not endorsed her and whether she stood by her description of him as liability back in 2022, before his return to the Oval Office about two years later. Responding to written questions about the donations, a spokesperson for the association said: “Winsome Earle-Sears is the only candidate in this race who will keep Virginia on the right track forged by Gov. Under their leadership, parents’ rights have been protected, Virginia’s economy is growing, and communities are safe.” Youngkin, who is term-limited, has offered more than $21,000 in support to Earle-Sears through his political action committee between March and June. When asked in June whether he would give more, his PAC said the governor was "working to elect the entire GOP ticket and is urging all Virginians to support the commonsense team this November to keep Virginia winning.” Republicans went into this election facing tough sledding in swing-state Virginia. In a prayer, Cherry asked God to “imbue her with strength and stamina for the days that are to come in the final, waning days of this election.” Wyatt encouraged voters to help Earle-Sears continue the successes of Youngkin’s administration.

Article: A study by the Pew Research Center found that users who encounter an AI summary when searching are about half as likely to click on a traditional search result than those who aren't met with one. Another survey from Bain found that 80% of consumers have come to rely on these "zero-click" results in at least 40% of searches — reducing organic web traffic by approximately 15%-25%, Bain said. GOOGL 1M mountain GOOGL in past month "Alphabet continues to defy the bears, just like this last quarter, and all of our survey data shows that search continues to be pretty robust from a query perspective," said Ives. "Now, AI is clearly a near-term potential headwind for Google, but we actually believe they turn it into a talent." Ives believes that Google — as well as rivals such as Meta Platforms — will learn how to monetize AI search. The potential losers While it's hard to pinpoint just exactly how this will affect business' bottom lines, Barclays anticipates that the impairments will begin to emerge more clearly from here. "Over time, as search referral traffic declines, companies are faced with a challenging situation whereby they can: 1) maintain profit margins while watching their top line decelerate or decline, or 2) supplement the loss of search referral traffic by spending more on customer acquisition across paid channels, which would compress margins but keep growth rates consistent," the bank wrote in a July note to clients. "In general, we view that neither of these are contemplated in the current consensus estimates over the medium term." Barclays found that companies that rely more on web traffic from search results versus direct traffic are more likely to face a larger disruption. Robert Pavlik of Dakota Wealth Management highlighted the following as stocks that could be negatively impacted by AI search: eBay , NerdWallet , Wayfair , Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Chegg . ChatGPT doesn't sell you a chair for your living room, so probably will have to direct you to a site some way." Ives even highlighted Pinterest as a stock he's bullish on amid the shifts in search.

The S & P 500 currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 22 times, near the top of its historical average over the past 20 years, when it's averaged about a 16 times multiple, according to FactSet data. "The idea of concentration risk of only a handful of stocks [that] are making all of the money and seeing all of the flow is not unique — we've seen this movie before," Savage told CNBC Pro in an interview. For that to happen, there needs to be more clarity as to how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates, as well as how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy. "So even if the Fed does cut 50 basis points [half a percentage point], as everyone expects, it might not be sufficient to make that equation work." "Welcome to my world of uncertainty," he added.

With that aim in mind, the growing presence of generative AI such as ChatGPT in the shopping ecosystem may next take a shape that has a seismic impact on the economic model of internet retail. Currently, a search for a large London Fog men's coat on ChatGPT will bring up a purchase option, but you still have to click over to London Fog's site to complete the transaction. Gen AI search engine Perplexity already has a deal with PayPal for this kind of function, allowing online shoppers to make purchases such as concert tickets and travel directly in chat, with payments completed with PayPal or Venmo, and PayPal handling the processing, shipping, tracking, and invoicing. The Financial Times reported last month that an integrated checkout system is coming to ChatGPT, with partners such as Shopify , so that users can complete the transaction within the platform. OpenAI has already rolled out several features designed to enhance shopping and other consumer experiences, and experts say that in one form or another, this further use of gen AI in retail's future should be expected, and companies need to be planning for the consequences today. "Enabling customers to purchase without leaving the chat will have a significant impact on the sales cycle," said Elizabeth Perkins, professor of practice of business administration and economics at Roanoke College. Power's senior director of banking intelligence, says he thinks that while AI checkout capabilities will disrupt the checkout ecosystem, big players will find a way to stay in the game. This will affect the upstarts the most, some of which will probably get gobbled up by larger competitors."

A recent study into the return of Indigenous fire burning in Australia’s Kimberley region showed that the annual massive wildfires in the region had reduced to once-in-a-decade events since the practice was reintroduced by the traditional owners of the land. The use of fire for sustainable resource management is also one of the recommendations that the organisation I work for, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, is recommending as part of its integrated fire management approach.

It feels like the universe is crazy.” Masiullah Sahil, 37, is accused of first-degree murder in Niazi’s death and, until last month, was being held in lieu of $750,000 bond. After prosecutors failed to indict him within three months, as Texas law requires, a judge ordered him released on a personal recognizance bond that required no payment, court records show.

Article: Mohamed Salah, one of soccer’s biggest stars, criticized the sport’s governing body in Europe over its tribute to Suleiman Al-Obeid, known as the “Pelé of Palestinian football,” which failed to mention how he died last week. “A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Salah, a forward for the Premier League club Liverpool and captain of the Egyptian national team, said in response. Salah, 33, has been a vocal advocate for increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, which the United Nations and other international experts say is on the brink of famine 22 months into Israel’s war with Hamas, which controls the enclave of about 2 million people. Finding food has become more difficult and deadly for Palestinians since late May, when the American and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over the distribution of aid after Israel lifted a two-and-half-month blockade. Eric Cantona, a former professional soccer player from France who was a forward for Manchester United, posted a tribute on Instagram alongside a photo of al-Obeid, asking, “HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE GOING TO LET THEM COMMIT THIS GENOCIDE???” Israel insists that it is fighting an existential war and rejects genocide allegations as antisemitic. On Saturday, the PFA shared a statement attributed to UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, praising al-Obeid for giving “talent and dedication to the children of Gaza” and giving their dreams “hope to blossom despite the suffering.” Al-Obeid scored more than 100 goals over his long career, including two for the Palestinian national team, “making him one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football,” the PFA said.

"Necaxa," produced by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, is in some ways like a spinoff of the two men's hugely successful “Welcome to Wrexham” series focused on an underdog Welsh soccer team — and its recent, remarkable rise.

They're having family issues, they're having injuries — there’s so much that goes into winning championships." Diego González, a former player and the current press officer for the club, said, “Necaxa, for me, is truly a family.” “In the end, we spend much more time at the club or with the team than even in our own homes, so it ends up being a family for us,” he said in a video interview. And I grew up in the ’90s, which was when we won, you know, three championships.” During that decade, Necaxa also had a silver age, winning three Mexican league titles. This isn’t the first time she has backed an underdog; she's credited with stepping up to save the first movie of the popular neo-noir revenge franchise “John Wick” with a last-minute investment of $6 million just over a decade ago.

Article: Actor Ray Brooks, voice of Mr Benn, dies aged 86 19 minutes ago Share Save Maia Davies & John Hand BBC News Share Save BBC Brooks's sons said their dad 'shunned the spotlight' despite his dazzling TV career TV actor Ray Brooks, who starred in some of the UK's best-known programmes in a career spanning five decades, has died aged 86. He played Norman Philips in the ITV soap in the 1960s, and arrived in Albert Square 40 years later to portray Joe Macer, who infamously murdered his wife Pauline Fowler. In a statement, the actor's sons Will and Tom said their dad thought he was best known for Mr Benn, "with people continually asking him to say the catchphrase 'as if by magic!'". Brooks starred alongside Sharon Duce in the 1980s primetime show Big Deal The list of TV shows in which Brooks appeared in the 1960s and 1970s reads like a run-down of the British small screen's biggest hits of the era. He played Georgio, the waiter in the crumbling hotel, in Carry On Abroad in 1972, and also killed daleks and cybermen in the 1966 Dr Who movie Daleks' Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. Brooks in Cathy Come Home, which is regarded as one of Britain's most ground-breaking TV programmes His most acclaimed role came early in his career when he played Reg in the gritty BBC TV play Cathy Come Home, which chronicled Britain's housing shortage in the late 1960s. In Big Deal, his character Robbie Box seeks to make a living playing poker and betting on horses and dogs - while trying to keep his relationship together with his partner Jan, played by Sharon Duce. The fast-talking Londoner became one of TV's best-loved working-class characters in an era of Del Boy Trotter and Arthur Daley Brooks joined EastEnders in 2005 as Joe Macer, who went on to marry and murder one of the show's original characters, Pauline Fowler, after she hit him with a frying pan

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows. Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable — with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher — in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data. High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don’t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.” An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. “This is showing a massive increase over a relatively short period of time.” That seemingly small increase in average dew points really means the worst ultra-sticky days that used to happen once a year, now happen several times a summer, which is what affects people, Lee said. For most of the summer, the Midwest and East were stuck under either incredibly hot high pressure systems, which boosted temperatures, or getting heavy and persistent rain in amounts much higher than average, Taylor said.

Article: The rise of generative AI and large language models has drastically shifted the cybersecurity landscape, empowering attackers with easy-to-use tools that can create realistic video and voice deepfakes, personalized phishing campaigns, and malware and malicious code. As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts. "AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization," Murphy said. In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said "We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live," adding that he sees a future with "billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field," helping workers "focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically" while also making "our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today." Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent. "AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do." ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team. "Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do," Murphy said, adding that it's like having a "teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability." Murphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings. Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins. "Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals." Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a "crawl, walk, run methodology." "You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken," he said. "I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems." What AI bots mean for cybersecurity workers While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement. Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles. "The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk." Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI. Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions. Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it "moderately beneficial," but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks. "You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface." Murphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal.

Article: Explicit death threats have been made against dozens of Afghan women working for the United Nations in Afghanistan, according to a new UN report, where their rights have been severely curtailed since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The UN mission to the country said female national staff were subjected to direct death threats in May, in the latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan published on Sunday. The report also highlighted other areas affecting women’s personal freedoms and safety, including inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry requiring women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head. A UN report from August 2024 found that Afghanistan’s Taliban government has “deliberately deprived” at least 1.4 million girls of their right to an education during its three years in power. About 300,000 more girls are missing out on school since UNESCO last carried out a count in April 2023, it said on Thursday, warning that “the future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy.” ICC targets Taliban for persecution of women The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants in July for two top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on charges of abuses against women and girls. “While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the court said in a statement in July. The Taliban has rejected the ICC warrants as “baseless rhetoric”, saying it does not recognise the ICC’s authority, and underlined the court’s failure to protect the “hundreds of women and children being killed daily” in Gaza.

Article: Firefighters in southern France have warned that a huge fire they have been battling, which spread across an area bigger than Paris, could reignite as the region continues to face a scorching heatwave. “It’s a challenging day, given that we are likely to be on red alert for heatwave from 4:00pm (14:00 GMT), which will not make things any easier,” said Christian Pouget, Aude’s prefect. The fire is no longer spreading but is still burning within a 16,000-hectare area, the chief of the region’s firefighter unit, Christophe Magny, said on Saturday, adding it would not be under control until Sunday evening. Temperatures this weekend are expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas, while Monday is forecast to be the “hottest day nationwide”, according to national weather service Meteo France. Fires burning elsewhere in Europe Elsewhere in Europe, fires also rage, with experts stating that European countries are becoming more prone to such disasters due to intensifying summer heatwaves linked to global warming. The national fire service said it had 12 teams on the ground and six Canadair planes fighting the blaze, which has torn through the national park in southern Italy since Friday.

He cheats on his wives, he cheats at golf, and now he's trying to cheat the American people out of their votes." Democratic state legislators from Texas have been huddling in Illinois and other blue states after leaving the state to deny GOP leaders a quorum in the state House.

At first he considered finding a way to move his career to Taiwan, until he realized he didn't want to deal with its demanding work culture. They timed it so Forrest would be in Taiwan for his kindergarten year, and decided to spend 13 months abroad to match up with the academic year, plus summer breaks, to get him back stateside for first grade. Courtesy of subject Jason says he viewed the goal like any household would save up for a home renovation project, and they used the You Need a Budget app to track their savings. 'This is not something that can afford to wait' Jason says timing was important: Not only did he want to make sure Forrest had enough time with his grandparents and to adjust to kindergarten, but taking the leap was also crucial for himself, Katie and the grandparents. I just didn't feel like that was a good trade off." We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before. Jason Lee American on a sabbatical in Taiwan What's more, he wanted to make sure that Forrest had time to interact with his grandparents while they are still in good health and mobile. Overall, Jason says, "as I look back to this year and I think about all the trips we were able to do and all the memories we were able to make, it's absolutely worth it." 'We are so happy right now' In addition to spending more quality time with family, Jason set a few personal and professional goals for himself for his sabbatical. "The whole last 10 years, I've been dictating my career next steps not based on what I want, but based on what the world or LinkedIn tells me I should want," Jason says. "I just realized how much of that has set me up for being unhappy, when I don't prioritize myself or what I want." By March, he sat down with Katie with a big realization that once they returned to the U.S., they were OK with not chasing the same salaries they had before. "We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before." Returning to the U.S. Katie gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, in early July, so the family of four will return to the states in October when she has a passport and is able to travel.

Article: CAIRO, Egypt — Mohamed Salah is questioning UEFA’s “farewell” to former Palestinian soccer player Suleiman Obeid who was reportedly shot and killed by Israeli forces while awaiting aid in Gaza. “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Salah asked on the social network X in response to a post from UEFA saying, “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pele.’ A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” Obeid, 41, was fatally shot by Israeli forces on Wednesday while he was waiting among crowds for aid near a distribution site in southern Gaza, the Palestine Football Association said. Obeid played 24 games for Palestine, scoring two goals, while he scored more than 100 over his career with local clubs, said the PFA, which described him as “one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football.” The PFA published a letter attributed to Aleksander Čeferin in which the UEFA president said he was “deeply saddened by the tragic death” of Obeid, who was “more than just a footballer. His passing is a great loss to the world of football and to everyone who understands the power of sport to inspire.” The PFA said Obeid’s death brings to 662 the number of Palestinian athletes and sporting officials killed since the 22-month war started.

Advertisement An October report from parliament’s Research Center showed 85 percent of Iran’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, 13 percent from hydropower and the remainder from renewables and nuclear power. Now, after months of unpredictable outages, Fatemeh has a survival routine: storing water in multiple containers, pouring it into her evaporative cooler when cuts occur and tossing blocks of ice into vents during extreme heat. Ripple effect The infrastructure crisis extends beyond household inconveniences and is threatening livelihoods across the economy as offices and retail shops are forced to close for hours or for the day. By the time power comes back, it is the end of their working day.” Experts attribute the energy crisis to insufficient investment, failure to adopt new technologies – both of which are influenced by international sanctions – and unsustainable consumption. As Iran approaches another winter with unresolved water and energy deficits, the experiences of Sara, Fatemeh, Shahram and millions like them suggest that the country’s infrastructure crisis has moved beyond temporary inconvenience to become a defining feature of modern Iranian life.

Article: Salmond allies dismiss Sturgeon memoir leak claims 37 minutes ago Share Save Katy Scott BBC Scotland News Share Save PA Media Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in 2013, formed a formidable political partnership Allies of Alex Salmond have dismissed Nicola Sturgeon's suggestion that he leaked details about an investigation into sexual misconduct claims made against him. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." In her upcoming memoir, Frankly, Sturgeon denied releasing details about the investigation, or any having any knowledge of who did. PA Media Kenny MacAskill has called for an inquiry to look into the Scottish government's investigation of claims against Alex Salmond MacAskill recently called for a public inquiry into the handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Salmond, who he succeeded as Alba leader. "This hypocrisy is yet another reason for an inquiry into the Scottish government's actions relating to Alex Salmond." Meanwhile, Chris McEleny claimed the investigation was a "stitch up" and that several public bodies had "conspired to jail Salmond". "Nicola might think she can fabricate her own version of the truth now that Alex is no longer here but the reality is her book will end up in a bargain basket whilst Alex Salmond will reside in the pages of the Scottish history books." Journalist David Clegg broke the story about the Salmond investigation when he was political editor of the Daily Record. "But I think it shows the level of suspicion and the deep rift that had formed between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon prior to his death." He said the "factual account" of what happened when the story emerged was laid out in his book, Break-Up, which he co-wrote with journalist Kieran Andrews. "But if it was Alex Salmond who had leaked it, when I phoned him up that night to put the claims to him, he did an incredible acting job of seeming surprised and shocked. "I have heard this from people close to Nicola Sturgeon before and it's always struck me as not credible and I would be very surprised if it was the case." Getty Images Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges after a two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh in March 2020 When asked if he knew the source of the leak, Clegg said: "I have had many nights thinking about who may have sent that in and I've had some suspicions over the years and guesses - but the truth is I'm not even sure who it was." In her book extract, published in The Sunday Times, Nicola Sturgeon also dismissed suggestions of a "conspiracy" between the Scottish government, civil service, the complainants and the Crown Office against Salmond. "And that would be that somebody thought this information was in the public interest and was concerned that it was going to be covered up so tried to get it out." Sturgeon previously spoke about Salmond in a Financial Times interview in January, where she said he "would be really rough on people." Salmond's widow, Moira, later said comments about her husband had caused the family "great distress". "My wish, and sincere hope, is that these attacks will now stop." Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon, who was first elected in 1999, will stand down as Glasgow Southside MSP next year The extract is the second to be published from Sturgeon's memoir. Elsewhere in the extracts, the former SNP leader describes the pain of suffering a miscarriage and sets out her views on sexuality, which she says she does not consider "to be binary".

Article: Lindsey Graham said in an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press" that Russia and Ukraine would have to swap some territory in any ceasefire agreement, echoing President Donald Trump's comments about land exchanges. "I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end," Graham, R-S.C., said during Sunday's interview. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine would "not give their land to occupiers." His comments came after Trump said on Friday that “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.” Graham said land exchanges would only happen "after you have security guarantees to Ukraine to prevent Russia from doing this again." "You need to tell Putin what happens if he does it a third time," Graham said, referring to Russia annexing Crimea in 2014 in addition to Russia's 2022 invasion. Asked during the interview whether it was the right move for Trump to hold a summit with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday in an attempt to broker a ceasefire agreement, Graham said he was "very okay" with the meeting, later adding that he hoped Zelenskyy could be involved. In 2023, he said in a statement that "The Ukrainians understand you don’t end wars by giving territory to the aggressor." The senator also warned at the time that if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine, "he will keep going," increasing the chance that NATO could be drawn into a war. and allies should continue arming Ukraine, put some European forces on the ground, and build up "economic integration." If Putin were to invade Ukraine again, he would "be fighting more than just Ukraine, having some European forces on the ground as trip wires," Graham said. He also pointed to the split of Germany's capital after World War II into East and West Berlin and later reunification, noting that the city "existed divided for a very long time."

Article: Because you haven't done it, it doesn't mean you can't do it if it costs a little money to do it, because you should have been budgeting for this for the last 30 years.” Senate Bill 1 addresses multiple problems found after the catastrophic July Fourth flooding. The bill establishes clear "lines of succession" in the event the EMC is unavailable, beginning with the county sheriff and then proceeding to the county commissioner with the longest continuous service. “You don't get to have a plan and say, 'We have a plan and we never actually tested the plan.'” Counties with 68,750 or fewer residents would need to have a united city and county incident command post during a disaster. “It will be one unit, so that when TDEM and other resources come into your being, they have one place, one team, and one person to coordinate with,” Perry said. “So that there's not this confusion over who's on first and what's on third.” Perry didn’t mince words when rebuking the shortcomings of how local leaders responded to the flooding. “I'm not saying some of them weren't legitimate reasons, but even had those people been there, truthfully listening to them, nobody knew what they were supposed to be doing.” The bill also includes additional rules for youth camps located in a 100-year floodplain. “All those warning systems are great, and we had some warning systems in place, but what we didn't have is leadership willing to do an evacuation call at the right time,” Perry said. Nim Kidd, the Chief of the TDEM, has told lawmakers that thousands of volunteers showed up to help in the days following the flooding – most of them "good-hearted Texans" that wanted to help in any way for "no thanks and no pay." Kidd said the state's Incident Support Task Force enables the establishment, within the first 12 hours of an incident, of a volunteer reception center where volunteers can check in and share their capabilities. It is about keeping a disaster organized from the beginning as early as possible.” Kidd said the background checks would be no different than if those when purchasing a gun. Vince Luciano, the Central Texas regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, stated that the bill’s volunteer requirements would be impossible to implement, as only law enforcement can conduct background checks, which would need to be processed through a dispatch center. “Dispatch centers were overloaded during all these events, so you're not going to have the ability to do that.” The Senate panel also advanced Senate Bill 2, by State Sen. The panel also advanced Senate Bill 13, which provides credits for cities and counties to make flood prevention fixes, and Senate Bill 43, which allows the TCEQ to issue permits for dam and reservoir repairs. Republicans claim that Democrats are blocking critical flood bills by not being present at the Capitol, but Democrats argue that Governor Abbott could act and allocate state funds towards these issues without lawmakers' approval.

I told my mom maybe it was just not meant for us to see each other again.” During a brief block on the order, the woman made it into the U.S., one of only about 70 refugees to arrive in the country since Trump took office. “It’s been a really devastating roller coaster for those families, to be stuck in this limbo of not knowing whether their hope of being resettled in the United States will ever come true,” said Melissa Keaney, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project. But Trump's executive order halting the program said communities didn’t have the ability to “absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.” Organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project and some refugees, including the Congolese woman and her mother, sued over Trump's order in February. — they push it shut right in front of me.” Looking back on her time in the Nyarugusu refugee camp, she remembers teaching her little brother to ride a bike and whispering with her sister late at night. With little hope of a viable future, her mother made a plan: The 15-year-old would walk to South Africa, where she would have a better chance of finishing school and building a life. “When I left, the idea of them going to be resettled was never in the mind at all.” Her family settled in Boise, Idaho, and her mother signed her up for the “follow to join” program in 2017. Last year, her case was handed over to lawyers volunteering their time "and that’s when we started seeing some light.” By January, she had her travel documents and gave up her home. The appeals court ordered the government to admit thousands more conditionally accepted refugees, but the administration has created new roadblocks, Keaney said, including decreasing the time refugees' security screenings are valid to 30 days —- down from three years.

Article: Ukraine’s military has said it struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Saratov region in an overnight drone attack, causing explosions and destruction, according to an army statement, as daily aerial exchanges intensify with diplomatic momentum to end the war in play. “[Ukrainian] drones are targeting … deeper into Russian territory [than] in the past, where previous attacks have been focused on the line of contact in the south and the western parts of Russia,” said Al Jazeera’s Osama bin Javed, reporting Moscow. Russia’s war in Ukraine is now into its in fourth year, as European leaders have welcomed plans by United States President Donald Trump to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on ending the conflict. Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region also killed two people travelling in a car in the Bilenkivska community on Saturday, as well as a 61-year-old woman who was in her home in the Vasylivka district, a local official reported. Europe stresses support for Ukraine ahead of Trump-Putin talks Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected any suggestion of land concessions to Russia as international efforts to end the war continue. Trump, who had promised to end the war within 24 hours of reentering the White House, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties were close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Finland, together with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, on Sunday issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s efforts, while stressing the need to maintain support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia. “The emphasis [of the European statement was] … that this is a war that is in Ukraine, but is in Europe too, and has huge potential ramifications for European security,” said Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal also reported that European officials who met US Vice President JD Vance in the United Kingdom on Saturday had presented a counterproposal for peace, which included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken.

Article: Jordan will host a Jordanian-Syrian-American meeting on Tuesday to discuss ways to support the rebuilding of Syria, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates says, as Damascus seeks investment deals with international companies to revive its war-ravaged economy. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s fledgling government has been grappling with the fallout from sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze fighters in the southern province of Suwayda as well as Israeli strikes on Syrian soldiers and the capital, Damascus. Jordan made its announcement after Damascus signed 12 agreements worth $14bn on Wednesday, including a $4bn agreement with Qatar’s UCC Holding to build a new airport and a $2bn deal to establish a subway in Damascus with the national investment corporation of the United Arab Emirates. The projects “will extend across Syria and represent a qualitative shift in infrastructure and economic life”, Talal al-Hilali, head of the Syrian Investment Authority, said during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Damascus. Syria’s new authorities have worked to attract investment for the reconstruction of infrastructure across the country after the US and the European Union lifted sanctions on Syria in the wake of al-Assad’s ouster. Other major developments on the investment front include the $2bn Damascus Towers project for residential high rises, signed with the Italian-based company UBAKO; a $500m deal for the Baramkeh Towers project, also in Damascus; and another $60m agreement for Baramkeh Mall.

Article: Early in her career, Cooke edited many of the films her husband directed with his brother, Joel (the renowned duo often simply referred to as the “Coen Brothers”), including “The Big Lebowski” and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” But for this film she joined her spouse in the writers’ room. In addition to their films, their unique relationship has also made headlines: Cooke is a lesbian, Coen is straight, they share two children and have been in a platonic union for more than 30 years. Writer Tricia Cooke, actor Margaret Qualley and writer/director Ethan Coen on the set of "Honey Don't!" Karen Kuehn / Courtesy Focus Features Cooke said that in “Honey Don’t!” which her husband directed, it was her mission to make lesbian protagonists visible within the noir genre. But, she added, “I couldn’t think of any noir genre movies that were lesbian or queer-themed.” Cooke was also inspired by the butch-femme dynamic and wanted to “switch the gender norms” in “Honey Don’t!” “Instead of it being like the masculine male detective, it would be great if the very feminine character was the detective, and the more butch character was the femme fatale,” she said of her initial thought process. Aubrey Plaza stars as MG Falcone and Margaret Qualley as Honey O’Donahue in "Honey Don't!" Courtesy Focus Features The main character also uses her feminine wiles, charisma and flowery dresses to disarm her opponents and catch them off guard to her benefit, so she can hit them hard with her sharp investigative skills. Cooke said the reverend’s sex scenes were meant to be a bit ridiculous, while the scenes between Honey and MG were intended to be sexy, with the first of their steamy scenes inspired by “Basic Instinct.” “We wanted them to feel sexual tension from the beginning, like it was a big spark in both of their lives,” Cooke said. Drew Devlin in "Honey Don't!" Courtesy Focus Features As for the film’s location, Cooke, who was raised in Southern California, said she and Coen wanted to deviate from the typically grim environments of noir films and use the backdrop of sun-drenched Bakersfield. But while the film’s opening was actually shot in Bakersfield, most of the film was shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the Coen Brothers shot “True Grit” and “No Country for Old Men.” Cooke noted that some of Albuquerque’s background terrain, such as its mountains, had to be edited out. With “Honey Don’t” about to hit theaters, Cooke and Coen are now working on the final installment of their sapphic trilogy: “Go Beavers.” Cooke said the script is in its early stages and is about “a crew team who gets together for their reunion, and they start dying off one by one.” However, Cooke noted, she’s not a fan of horror and is hoping to steer the story in a different direction, one that is specifically inspired by the 1971 Australian outback survival film “Walkabout.” “That film is whoa, psychedelic.

Article: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under pressure from all sides Sunday as his controversial plan to seize Gaza City drew backlash inside his government and on the streets of Israel, while malnutrition deaths in the Gaza Strip continued to climb. Netanyahu only conceded there was “deprivation” in Gaza, but said “no one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war” if Israel was implementing a “starvation policy.” Netanyahu went on to defend the new military offensive, saying Israel had “no choice” but to “finish the job” and “defeat Hamas,” while claiming that "hundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza." But his critics on the left say his proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a “foolish” half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it. “In your own words, you admitted that the prime minister’s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,” Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. “You also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.” The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting later Sunday to discuss Israel's proposed offensive, which has been condemned by Britain, France, Australia and other Western governments. James Kariuki, the U.K.'s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan "will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza." It comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May. The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that at least 99 people in Gaza, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year, noting the real toll was most likely higher. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through air drops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave’s population of 2 million people. We want international protection.” With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during airdrops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office. The plan, which Netanyahu’s government announced Friday, outlines five goals for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing “an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.” Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hardliners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center, said the plan was full of “hollow slogans.” “There is a very common slogan: ‘We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,’” he said. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.” Netanyahu said Sunday that his goal was to get the hostages out alive and recover the remains of those had had died. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to “Arab forces,” adding Sunday that "several candidates" are being looked at for the establishment of a new "transitional authority." He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday sought to defend a new military offensive in one of Gaza’s most populated areas amid growing condemnation at home and abroad, declaring that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” He spoke to foreign media minutes before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Gaza. Notably, Netanyahu said he has directed Israel’s military in recent days to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during 22 months of war. He also pushed back against what he called a “global campaign of lies” — and said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of Israel’s strongest backers, had “buckled under” by announcing that Germany won’t authorize exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice. The prime minister, who has asserted that there is “no starvation in Gaza,” did acknowledge hunger there, saying, “there was a problem with deprivation, no question about it.” Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites, he said, but gave no details. More Palestinians killed as they seek aid At least 26 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said, as families of Israeli hostages called for a general strike to protest Netanyahu’s plans to expand military operations in Gaza City. The dead included 15 killed while waiting for aid trucks close to the newly built Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites A further six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and Shifa hospital in Gaza City. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before the fire was aimed toward crowds of aid-seekers trying to reach a food distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but its early operations have been marred by deaths and chaos, with aid-seekers coming under gunfire near routes leading to the sites. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today and these incidents appear to be linked to crowds trying to loot aid convoy.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving Israeli troops near central Gaza aid sites. Seven people were killed in airstrikes, local hospitals said — three people near the fishermen’s port in Gaza City and four people, two of them children, in a strike that hit a tent in Khan Younis. WATCH: Understanding the stages of starvation A total of 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since late June when the ministry started to count that age category, it said. Also Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz toured the northern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where about 40,000 Palestinians have been driven from their homes this year in the West Bank’s largest displacement since Israel captured the territory in 1967. Katz said the military would remain in the area’s refugee camps at least until the end of the year, and said the number of warnings about attacks against Israelis in the West Bank had decreased by 80% since the operation began in January.

Article: It's too soon for President Donald Trump 's newest tariff rates to show up in the numbers just yet, but we'll be watching for any inflation signs from the levies already in place. The CPI and PPI arrive after a weak July jobs report — and the accompanying downward revisions to the prior two-month totals — that caused investors to dramatically reconsider the health of the U.S. Traders went from betting the Fed will keep rates steady again in September — thanks to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell throwing cold water on the idea at the Fed's July meeting — to overwhelmingly pricing in a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Now comes the CPI and PPI, which shine a light on the price-stability piece of the Fed's mandate and, in particular, the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on the rate of inflation. In the June CPI report, inflation picked up to 2.7% overall and 2.9%, when excluding the more volatile food and energy prices, from the May rates of 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively. "We see the biggest risk to markets in the [second half of the year] from a reacceleration in both goods and service inflation, leading the Fed to remain on hold and putting upward pressure on interest rates," strategists at Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core CPI is projected to rise 0.3% month over month and 3.1% on a 12-month basis; that would be an acceleration from 0.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in June. For the PPI, which is seen as a leading indicator for the CPI because it measures what companies pay for their own inputs like steel, the consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain after being flat in June, according to Dow Jones. While it's good to get another month's worth of data, the CPI and PPI for July won't answer that question entirely, in part because tariff levels are still evolving, and in part because businesses that may eventually raise prices are still working through inventory accumulated before duty rates went up. However, at least for Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, he told CNBC last week that he's getting more comfortable with the idea of cutting rates without knowing the full effect of tariffs. "There's a bunch of data that I know and that I've got confidence in, and there's data that I don't know and we're not going to know for a while," Kashkari said Wednesday on "Squawk Box." "The data that I think we know is that the economy is slowing. All of that suggests the real underlying economy is slowing." He continued, "The part I don't have confidence in yet is, what are the ultimate effects of tariffs going to be on inflation? Other data: While the CPI and PPI are the biggest data points of the week, there are a few other releases that the market will be watching due to the heightened focus on the health of the economy post-jobs report. On Thursday morning, we'll get the weekly initial jobless claims report — a measure of both first-time unemployment insurance filings, which can be used to gauge layoff activity among employers, and so-called continuing claims, which offer insights into how easily people who lose their jobs can find a new gig.

Article: 'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder' bosses reveal which celeb they really want as a guest star Season 3 of "The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder" mixes heart and humor with big guest stars! The series stars Kyla Pratt (Penny Proud), Tommy Davidson (Oscar Proud), Paula Jai Parker (Trudy Proud), JoMarie Payton (Suga Mama), Cedric the Entertainer (Uncle Bobby), Karen Malina White (Dijonay Jones), Soleil Moon Frye (Zoey Howzer), Alisa Reyes (LaCienega Boulevardez), Carlos Mencia (Felix Boulevardez), Alvaro Gutierrez (Papi), Raquel Lee Bolleau (Nubia Gross), Marcus T. So, you know, we start in Paris and we go through Brazil, Nairobi, and it was important to tell that story because, A) it was good to see the family kind of unified to take this adventure, and then B) because you get to see a spectrum of blackness all around the world," said Smith. "That's the thing that sort of hangs around our necks as Black people, because we still feel the effects of it to this day, because there's every shade of African American in this country, or in the world, certainly. And for those who aren't aware of what it is, they will be aware after this." The show mixes heart and humor with each episode, a balance that Smith and Farquhar believe is a reason for its success. "I think what's great about this show is we can actually go from a fun romp where we take you around the world with lots of comedy, you know, a super spy episode, and then tackle some real politics, some real issues within our community," Smith explained. "It allows us to be very intimate and very intentional in terms of the emotions we want to get across." Season three features some notable names as guest stars, including Janelle James, Sanaa Lathan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Lynn Whitfield, Adrienne Warren, Kirk Franklin, and Bubba Wallace.

Pritzker — whose state has become a haven for Texas Democrats protesting the GOP-led effort — rejected the idea that congressional maps in Illinois are politically gerrymandered, arguing that the maps were redrawn after the census, which, he said, is "how it's done in this country."

Article: 5 on Truth Social of a bloodied Edward Coristine, known by his LinkedIn handle of “ Big Balls .” After a group of teenagers severely beat a prominent employee of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency in an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., Trump threatened a federal takeover of the nation’s capital. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote. “Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. Data shows that in recent years, the district has had a significant crime problem, but offenses such as homicide, gun-related and aggravated assault, carjacking, vehicle theft, robbery and sexual assault have declined from COVID-19-era peaks. While the home rule law granted the district significant autonomy for local governance, the city still answers to Congress on certain matters, including budgetary oversight and the ability to overturn local legislation. history, members of Congress have interfered in city affairs to fiddle with everything from how long pools are open to banning the city from using its own tax money for a needle exchange program,” said George Derek Musgrove, a University of Maryland-Baltimore County historian. It would have to act to reclaim that authority, or to delegate it to another entity, like the executive branch.” Congress’ Republican majorities have so far supported Trump’s agenda with near-unanimity, but a repeal of home rule isn’t a sure thing. in order for him to wipe out its Democratic leadership and replace it with people who are loyal only to him, that strikes me as precisely what the framers did not want.” Short of a law, the president has other ways to exert influence in the district, including the authority to mobilize the D.C. The Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control over the city’s police department in an emergency — something Trump threatened to do in 2020 amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. “…Frankly, the federal government should take over control and management of Washington, D.C.” During a July 2024 Florida campaign rally, Trump promised to “take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C., and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.” Trump echoed this in February, again focusing on blight and crime: “I think the federal government should take over the governance of D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.” It mandates beautification efforts such as graffiti removal and enhanced park maintenance, and it includes provisions to address violent crime and issues related to homelessness. In 1874, local conservatives angry about voting rights for local Black and working-class white residents teamed up with opponents of Reconstruction-era voting in the South and some of their Northern allies to roll back democratic laws in the district, Musgrove said.

Article: Ski jumping faces more controversy with six months to go until the Winter Olympics after the first high-level competition of the new season saw numerous athletes disqualified over ill-fitting suits. The governing body says it's “perfectly normal.” The ski jumping world was rocked in March by the discovery of illegally altered suits on the Norwegian team at the world championships. In Saturday's first event of the 2025-26 season — a summer Grand Prix event on an artificial surface in France — six male ski jumpers were disqualified because of suit issues such as waist size and three more were “not permitted to start.” Another jumper from Japan was blocked from competing as the Grand Prix continued Sunday. The federation told The Associated Press in an e-mailed statement that it's treating the spate of disqualifications as the natural result of tightening up the rules after the Norwegian suit scandal. “It’s also important to highlight that these disqualifications are clearly a result of technical inadequacies — there’s no sign whatsoever of ill intent from the teams.” FIS indicated that a further nine men and five women didn't compete following a “technical approval” process, though it wasn't clear if all of those cases involved their suits.

ATLANTA -- A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday.

Article: The White House stepped up pressure against Harvard Friday, adding a new investigation into the university’s patents and renewing a host of claims that the university is unfit to host international students. The two sides have been working to resolve their differences in recent weeks, but a court motion filed by the government on Friday in a dispute over international students suggested there is still deep acrimony. The motion accuses Harvard of failure to control crime, and claims that Harvard’s leadership has “shown itself to be incapable of properly hosting, monitoring, disciplining, and reporting on its foreign students.” On the same day, Commerce Secretary Howard W. President Trump issued a directive that would require colleges and universities to submit reams of new data on students to check whether they are complying with a Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action. In the court case involving Harvard, the Justice Department was asking a judge to throw out one of two pending lawsuits filed by Harvard against the administration, this one involving the right of the nation’s oldest university’s right to host international students. When Judge Allison Burroughs of federal court in Boston temporarily blocked the administration action, the White House countered in June by issuing a proclamation blocking international students that invoked a different provision of law. It has no effect on the university’s lawsuit against the administration about research funding cuts, a case that focuses heavily on constitutional and procedural concerns.) The government’s effort could have disrupted the lives of about 5,000 international students attending Harvard last spring, another 2,000 recent graduates, as well as a new cohort of students who plan to arrive this fall. The university has accused the government of retaliating against it for its refusal to bend to the White House’s efforts to control the university’s “governance, curriculum and the ideology of faculty and students.” In its filing Friday, the administration denied that contention. The university’s student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, has reported that the campus police responded to nearly twice as many crimes on campus in 2023 as in 2021, mostly over reports of stolen electric bikes and scooters. In a statement, Harvard said the motion on Friday “has no impact on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and scholars.” “The university will continue to defend its rights — and the rights of its students and scholars,” the statement added. In a separate move on Friday, the administration added to its pressure campaign against Harvard when the Commerce Department said it would investigate whether the university was complying with federal laws and regulations around intellectual property that emerge from government-backed research. Lutnick did not include any evidence showing that Harvard, whose researchers generally secure scores of patents each year, had violated the law, but he said that the Commerce Department thought that the university had “failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer.” Patents can be extraordinarily lucrative for research universities, with their collective values climbing far into the millions of dollars. In a statement on Friday, Harvard blasted the Commerce Department’s letter as “unprecedented” and “yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.” “Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are lifesaving and industry-redefining,” the university said, adding that it was “fully committed” to complying with federal law.

Article: That's how I felt about last week where the market took a huge number of stocks out and shot them, including some of ours — more on that when we get to Thursday's Monthly Meeting for Club subscribers — but the sellers could not stop Apple, the most unlikely of winners for this moment, and one that defined last week's tape. Case in point: the traditional market-cap weighed S & P 500 climbed 2.4% over the past week while a modified version of the index that assigns each company the same influence, known as the equal-weight S & P 500 , advanced merely 0.8%. First, good short-sellers like to go after either the most white hot of companies — in the current moment, that's a name like Palantir — or companies with a stock that is already rolling over, like that of Apple. Announced to much fanfare last June, its suite of AI software tools dubbed Apple Intelligence is widely ridiculed and key features like an AI upgrade of Siri have been delayed. We also see the headlines about the company losing people who might, or might not, be working on AI, which may be the reason they seemingly have no AI strategy. We in the media cannot resist asking business leaders questions like, "How are you using AI?" And we ask it to any CEO, no matter how clueless they may be about AI and how little they might need AI. Most of the time their answers sound rehearsed, kind of like when I delivered my lines playing Lieutenant Rooney in "Arsenic and Old Lace" as a junior in high school. But that route may no longer be open to them because of a crucial win by the Biden-era Justice Department against Alphabet last year, one where a federal judge deemed Alphabet and its search-engine business violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws monopolies. At one point, Apple might have been waiting for any of the generative AI-infused search engines to come along and pay them $20 billion to do the same thing to block any other comer. Mainly they know that it doesn't have a strategy — in itself a great reason to short it — and second, they know it isn't going to get anyone to pay it for sending Safari users to their AI bot. I think many big short-sellers have also been betting against Apple precisely because that remedy ruling is imminent and the ruling could mean that Apple could immediately lose that $20 billion from Google. I know it because I begged them to buy Netflix several times when the putative target was worth about $25 billion to $50 billion, and Apple's management seemed determined to rule that out along with anything else that came to mind. Nevertheless, the combination of not getting paid the $20 billion from Google — and perhaps paying an outrageous amount to buy Perplexity outright — is not something you want to buy the stock of Apple for. Apple's key supplier Foxconn first started making iPhones in India in 2019 and some of the supply-chain issues that arose during the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to additional emphasis being placed on India as a production hub. Then it became evident that Trump didn't like that India had become somewhat of a weird ally/client state of Russia because of Russian oil, and that the president did not want any iPhones made anywhere but the U.S. When I interviewed Cook and asked him about his relationship with Trump after Trump had called him out for doing business in India, he said the relationship was a good one. Sure, you may not think it matters and it is awfully difficult even for the government to spend $600 billion unless the money goes to the Pentagon or the interest on the national debt. Oh, and if you needed one more reason to be short: Apple had a very good last quarter, but it was presumed that the success of the quarter came from pull-through to beat the tariffs and it wasn't regarded as consequential. So, let's wrap up the metaphor: Apple has no AI strategy and even if it gets one, it will have to pay through the noise for it, perhaps endlessly, as you need all the chips that fellow Club name Nvidia makes to have a winning AI offering. I've had an own-don't-trade philosophy toward Apple for ages but even I was struck about the run from $210 a share to $220 in after-hours trading early last week when Trump blessed Apple's largesse. All of this occurred at a time that most of the market was rolling over except, weirdly, medical technology names — check out Becton Dickinson , Medtronic and our Abbott Labs — and some scattered retailers, including Club-owned TJX Companies , a heavily shorted stock for no reason other than the chart.

Article: In a month that’s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger’s highly anticipated horror film “Weapons” did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. “Both are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.” “Weapons” transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The film is Cregger’s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, “Barbarian.” That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre. “It starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.” The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. “Weapons ”also joins a stream of successful horror movies this year, its opening numbers coming in just behind “Final Destination: Bloodlines” and “Sinners.” With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S.

Article: Police in London on Saturday arrested 522 people who were protesting against the United Kingdom’s recent decision to ban the group Palestine Action, a tally thought to include the highest-ever recorded at a single protest in the British capital. The Metropolitan Police on Sunday updated its previous arrest tally of 466 and said that all but one of the 522 arrests took place at a protest in central London’s Parliament Square and were for displaying placards backing Palestine Action. The other arrest for the same offence took place at nearby Russell Square as thousands rallied at a Palestine Coalition march demonstrating against Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed at least 61,430 people and wounded 153, 213. The protests were the latest in a series of rallies denouncing the British government’s ban of Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act 2000 on July 5, days after the group took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.4m) of damage to two aircraft. Huda Ammori, cofounder of Palestine Action, said ahead of Saturday’s protests that they would “go down in our country’s history as a momentous act of collective defiance of an unprecedented attack on our fundamental freedoms”. “If this was happening in another country, the UK government would be voicing grave concerns about freedom of speech and human rights,” Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director Areeba Hamid said on Saturday. Police across the UK have made scores of similar arrests since July 5, when being a member of Palestine Action or supporting the group became a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Police announced this week that the first three people had been charged in the English and Welsh criminal justice system with such backing following their arrests at a July 5 demonstration. In its update on Sunday, the Met revealed a further 26 case files following other arrests on that day are due to be submitted to prosecutors “imminently” and that more would follow related to later protests. The protesters, who planned to march to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s residence in Downing Street for a rally, include Noga Guttman, a cousin of 24-year-old captive Evyatar David, who featured in a video that enraged Israelis when it was released by Hamas last week. “We are united in one clear and urgent demand: the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,” Stop the Hate, a coalition of groups organising the march, said in a statement.

Article: Netanyahu defends Gaza plans as Israel heavily criticised at UN Security Council 11 minutes ago Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save Reuters UN ambassadors have condemned Israel's plans to "take control" of Gaza City as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted it was the "best way" to end the war. During a press conference, which Netanyahu said was intended to "puncture the lies", the Israeli leader said the planned offensive would move "fairly quickly" and would "free Gaza from Hamas". Meanwhile, Israel came under heavy criticism at an emergency meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, with the UK, France and others warning the plan risked "violating international humanitarian law". Along with Denmark, Greece and Slovenia, they called for the plan to be reversed, adding it would "do nothing to secure the return of hostages and risks further endangering their lives". UN Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenca told the meeting: "If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction." Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across Israel to oppose the government's plan, fearing it puts the lives of hostages at risk.

Article: A senior United Nations official has warned the UN Security Council (UNSC) that Israel’s plan to seize Gaza City risked “another calamity” in the Gaza Strip with far-reaching consequences, as five more people in Gaza reportedly died from starvation – bringing the overall toll to 217, including 100 children. UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas Miroslav Jenca on Sunday told an emergency weekend meeting that if implemented, the plan could result in the displacement of all civilians from Gaza City by October 7, 2025, affecting some 800,000 people, many of them already previously displaced. Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the UNSC that Israel was aiming for “the destruction of the Palestinian people through forced transfer and massacres to facilitate its annexation of our land”. Advertisement France’s Deputy Permanent UN Representative Jay Dharmadhikari condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the plan, which he said would have “dramatic humanitarian consequences” for civilians already “living in horrifying conditions”. In a separate statement, the foreign ministers of Spain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Portugal and Slovenia warned that Israel seizing Gaza City would be “a major obstacle to implementing the two-state solution, the only path towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. Israel to ‘finish the job’ in Gaza Despite the international backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained defiant over the plan to seize Gaza’s largest urban centre, which was approved by Israel’s security cabinet on Friday. “I don’t want to talk about exact timetables, but we’re talking in terms of a fairly short timetable because we want to bring the war to an end.” He said Israel had “no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas”, given the group’s refusal to lay down its arms. Netanyahu said the military had been given the green light to “dismantle” what he described as two remaining Hamas strongholds: Gaza City in the north and al-Mawasi further to the south. “We will do so by first enabling the civilian population to safely leave the combat areas to designated safe zones.” While the prime minister stressed that these “safe zones” would be given “ample food, water, and medical care”, guards at the controversial Israel- and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), purportedly established to deliver aid to the starving Palestinian population, have routinely opened fire on the aid seekers, killing dozens at a time. ‘Unacceptable catastrophe’ The director of the coordination division at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that the “unacceptable catastrophe” unfolding in Gaza must be brought to an end as he addressed the UN Security Council via videolink on Sunday. Ramesh Rajasingham expressed concern over “the prolonged conflict, the reports of atrocities and further human toll that is likely to unfold following the government of Israel’s decision to expand military operations in Gaza”. Ahmad Alhendawi, Save the Children International’s director for the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, told Al Jazeera that his team on the ground was seeing an “exponential increase” in the number of malnutrition cases, with effects that can “span generations”.

Article: What to know about how Trump's judicial picks could reshape abortion rights for decades CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House. In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because "this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life." One from Missouri spread misinformation about medication abortion, including that it "starves the baby to death in the womb" in a lawsuit aiming to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial appointments "are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement." "It's a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash," she said. The nominees represent Trump's 'promises' to Americans, White House says Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said "every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling." "The Democrats' extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump's commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion," Fields said in a statement to the AP. Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time "This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion, saying he's going to leave it to the states, while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," said Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All.

Article: The sheriff of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, was arrested Friday by the FBI for allegedly pressuring a national cannabis retailer trying to do business in Boston into letting him buy $50,000 worth of stock before the firm went public. Steven Tompkins, the sheriff of Suffolk County, which encompasses Boston, Chelsea and Revere, was taken into custody in Florida and will appear in federal court in Boston at a later date, prosecutors said in a statement. Advertisement “We believe what the Sheriff saw as an easy way to make a quick buck on the sly is clear cut corruption under federal law,” Ted Docks, FBI special agent in charge of the Boston division, said in a statement. Public servants must be held to the highest of ethical standards, and those falling short will be rooted out.” The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment, unsealed Friday morning, does not name the cannabis company in question but identifies it as a national cannabis cultivation and retail company that operated dispensaries in Massachusetts as well as several other states. Advertisement At the time of the company’s founding, the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission was charged with overseeing the regulation and licensing of companies looking to sell cannabis in the state, where recreational marijuana was legalized in 2016. But as the company sought to obtain its license — between 2020 and July 2023 — Tompkins allegedly tried to pressure the owner to sell him stock in the company before it went public. Advertisement The owner of the company eventually relented and agreed to sell shares in the company to Tompkins while it was still private, according to the indictment, fearing that Tompkins would wield his position as sheriff to jeopardize the company’s license. Between around May 2022 and July 2023, fearing that Tompkins would terminate his office’s partnership with the company, the owner refunded the $50,000 to Tompkins through five checks, the indictment claims.

In response, a Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that "cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them." Nvidia on Tuesday similarly rejected Chinese accusations that its AI chips include a hardware function that could remotely deactivate the chips, also known as a "kill switch." Tensions between the U.S. Nvidia's H20 chips — a less-advanced semiconductor compared to its flagship H100 and B100 chips, for example — were developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market after initial export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023. export controls on some Nvidia chips are rooted in national security concerns that Beijing could use the more advanced chips to gain an advantage broadly in AI, as well as in its military applications.

Article: Netanyahu defends new military offensive in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his country's planned military takeover of Gaza City and claimed once again that there is no starvation in Gaza. JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel "has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" of Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a "global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a global platform for outrage but little action on the war. SEE ALSO | 'Palestinian Pele' killed while awaiting aid, soccer association says He said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of Israel's strongest backers, had "buckled under" the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to "bring in more foreign journalists" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. We have frankly run out of words to describe it." More Palestinians killed as they seek aid At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. "But I have no other choice to feed the kids." Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: "There were no incidents at or near our sites today." Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites. Seven people were killed in airstrikes, local hospitals said - three near the fishermen's port in Gaza City and four, two of them children, in a tent in Khan Younis. Labor strike urged in Israel over looming offensive Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations in Gaza City, fearing it will endanger their loved ones.

The template has inspired more than 78,000 videos on TikTok, where people use it to represent spamming actions like skipping songs, annoying their friends or fast-forwarding through workplace compliance trainings. A lizard mashup with the 2010 classic “Like A G6” accrued more than 12 million views, and others set to hits like Eminem’s “Rap God,” Cardi B’s “WAP” and AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” also got millions of views each.

The film is Cregger’s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, “Barbarian.” That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre. “It starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.” The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. “Weapons ”also joins a stream of successful horror movies this year, its opening numbers coming in just behind “Final Destination: Bloodlines” and “Sinners.” Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S.

Article: In response, Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: "The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people." Trump-Putin meeting spikes worries Saturday's statement by top European leaders came after the White House confirmed the U.S. president was willing to grant Putin the one-on-one meeting Russia has long pushed for, and suggestions from Trump that a peace deal could include "some swapping of territories." That raised fears that Kyiv may be pressured into giving up land or accepting other curbs on its sovereignty. A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they aren't allowed to speak publicly, told The Associated Press that Trump remained open to a trilateral summit with both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, but for now, he will have a bilateral meeting requested by Putin. The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. Calls for a lasting peace deal Saturday's statement, signed by the president of the European Union and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the UK, stressed the need for a "just and lasting peace" for Kyiv, including "robust and credible" security guarantees. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News on Sunday that a good deal would mean preventing an emboldened Russia, and aggressors elsewhere, from trying to once again redraw borders by force. I have every confidence in the world that (President Trump) is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he's going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably," he said. He argued that "Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian" soldier, but said the West should give Kyiv robust security guarantees, keep some of its forces on the ground "as trip wires," and keep arming Ukraine "so that Russia will be deterred by the most lethal army on the continent of Europe." A fruitless push toward a truce A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. Trump also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Mark Galeotti, a British expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, says Moscow's tactic of encircling towns in eastern Ukraine has brought a string of territorial gains for Russia, and Putin "does not appear to feel under pressure." For the Kremlin, "further delaying any more serious U.S. Zelenskyy rules out giving up territory Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine "will not give Russia any awards for what it has done" and that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." Ukrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily.

Article: Bowen: Israeli settlers intensify campaign to drive out West Bank Palestinians 11 minutes ago Share Save Jeremy Bowen International editor, reporting from the occupied West Bank Share Save Oren Rosenfeld/BBC Meir Simcha agreed to talk, but he wanted to do it somewhere special, because for him, this is a special time. In a place where nation, religion and war are linked inextricably with politics and the possession of land, Simcha chose a patch of shade under a fig tree next to a spring of fresh water. Simcha is the leader of a group of Jewish settlers steadily transforming a big stretch of the rolling terrain south of Hebron in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It was a small oasis at the foot of a steep, arid, rocky slope and the location, if not our conversation, felt peaceful in a way that the West Bank rarely does these days. The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea started well over a century ago when Zionists from Europe began to buy land to set up communities in Palestine. The consequences of the last 22 months of war, and however more months are left before a ceasefire, threaten to spread across years and generations, just like the Middle East war in 1967, when Israel captured Gaza from Egypt and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan. The enemy in our land lost hope to stay here, says Meir Simcha Evidence based on statements by ministers, influential local leaders like Simcha and accounts by witnesses on the ground reveal that the pressure is part of a wider agenda, to accelerate the spread of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to extinguish any lingering hopes of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Palestinians and human rights groups also accuse the Israeli security forces of failing in their legal duty as occupiers to protect Palestinians as well as their own citizens - not just turning a blind eye to settler attacks, but even joining in. Israel's rejects the ICJ's view and claims that the Geneva Conventions forbidding settlement in occupied territories do not apply - a view disputed by many of its own allies as well as international lawyers. In the shade of the fig tree, Simcha denied all suggestions he had attacked Palestinians, as he celebrated the fact that most of the Arab farmers who used to graze their animals on the hills he has seized and tend their olives in the valleys had gone. I care about my people." Simcha says the Palestinians who left villages and farms near the hilltops he has claimed simply realised that God intended the land for Jews, not for them. A statement issued by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said: "We are deeply troubled by alleged widespread intimidation, violence, land dispossession, destruction of livelihoods and the resulting forcible displacement of communities, and we fear this is severing Palestinians from their land and undermining their food security. "The alleged acts of violence, destruction of property, and denial of access to land and resources appear to constitute a systemic pattern of human rights violations." Simcha has a plan to dig a swimming pool at the base of the spring where we sat to talk. When I met him first, not long after Hamas burst through Israel's border defences on 7 October 2023, he lived in a small group of isolated caravans on a hilltop overlooking the Judean desert as it sweeps down to the Dead Sea. But now men like Simcha are at the centre of events, with their leaders in the cabinet, leading the charge, married, older, thinking not just about swimming pools for their children but of victory over the Palestinians, once and for all, and everlasting Jewish possession of the land. Over the last almost 60 years, successive Israeli governments and some wealthy sympathisers have invested vast amounts of money and energy to get to the point where around 700,000 Israeli Jews live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The bigger settlements look like small towns, and the West Bank is carved into sections by a network of roads and tunnels built by Israel that are as much about staking an immovable claim to the land as they are about traffic management. In many parts of the West Bank, you just do not see them anymore, especially in places like the settlements east of Shiloh on the road to Nablus, where small groups of shacks and caravans on hilltops have connected up into sprawling residential hubs linked by sinuous road networks. Motaz Tafsha, mayor of West Bank town Sinjel: "They want to take our land, and they have the green light" When first I reported on settlements, Israeli leaders would often say that national security depended on them. Just like the kibbutz movement of collective farms in the 1920s and 1930s inside present-day Israel, settlements in the occupied territories after 1967 were strategically placed as a first line of defence. Trading land taken by Israel in 1967 for peace with Palestinians who wanted it for a state was at the heart of the Oslo peace process that ended in violence but provided a false dawn of hope in the 1990s. There were headlines around the world when, after months of secret negotiations in Norway in 1993, there was a handshake on the White House lawn between Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. After a final disastrous summit at Camp David in 2000, the hopes of 1993 were replaced by the deadly violence of a Palestinian uprising and a massive military response from Israel. Among religious Zionists in Israel, the victory in 1967 had supercharged a wave of messianism - the belief that a divine being was coming who would redeem the Jewish people. During his first interrogation by the Israeli security service, Shin Bet, he asked for a drink so he could toast the fact that he had saved the Jewish people from a disastrous path that denied the will of God. They believe the victory in 1967 was a miracle granted by God, that restored to the Jewish people the ancestral lands that he had given them in the mountain heartland of Judea and Samaria - the area that much of the rest of the world calls the West Bank. Last summer, the Minister for Settlements and National Missions, Orit Strock, put it like this to a sympathetic audience at an outpost in the Hebron hills, the area where Simcha operates. Oren Rosenfeld/BBC Police guard a digger extending the settlement of Carmel near Umm al-Khair, in the southern West Bank At a ceremony in one of them in the south Hebron Hills in April this year, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose powers over the running of the occupation also make him something like the governor of the West Bank, donated 19 all-terrain vehicles to the settlers. On 28 July this year, Yinon Levi fired a bullet that killed Odeh Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist, during a disturbance in the West Bank village of Umm al-Khair. Oren Rosenfeld/BBC The settlement movement in the West Bank has powered ahead since 7 October, under the direction of hardline Jewish nationalists in the cabinet, men like Itamar Ben Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, who is Strock's leader in the Religious Zionist Party. The two ministers are very different people to the secular politicians - retired generals like Yigal Allon from the Israeli left and Ariel Sharon from the right - two men who drove the settlement movement forward in its first two decades after 1967. So that settler on the hilltop nearby a Palestinian herding community that was beating them up and throwing stones for the past two three or four years, trying to get him out, now is the soldier or the officer in uniform with a gun responsible for the area. "So when he comes to a Palestinian and says, 'you have 24 hours to pack up and leave or I'm going to shoot you,' the Palestinian knows there is nothing to protect him." Oren Rosenfeld/BBC

Article: United States President Donald Trump has pledged to evict homeless people from the nation’s capital, after days of musing about taking federal control of Washington, DC, where he has falsely suggested crime is on the rise. It’s all going to happen very fast.” The announcement comes after Trump earlier this week threatened to deploy the National Guard as part of a crackdown on what he falsely says is rising crime in Washington, DC. “I’m going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” The White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from the city. According to the Community Partnership, an organisation working to reduce homelessness in Washington, DC, on any given night, there are 3,782 single people experiencing homelessness in the city of about 700,000 people. Advertisement A White House official said on Friday that more federal law enforcement officers were being deployed in the city following a violent attack on a young Trump administration staffer, which angered the president. Crime in DC at ‘a 30-year low’ Alleged crimes investigated by federal agents on Friday night included “multiple persons carrying a pistol without license”, motorists driving on suspended licences, and dirt bike riding, according to a White House official on Sunday. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low,” Bowser said on US media MSNBC’s news segment The Weekend. The city’s police department reports that violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 was down by 26 percent in Washington, DC, compared with last year, while overall crime was down about 7 percent. Trump’s threat to send in the National Guard comes weeks after he deployed California’s military reserve force into Los Angeles to quell protests over immigration raids, despite objections from local leaders and law enforcement. The US Congress has control of Washington, DC’s budget after the district was established in 1790 with land from neighbouring Virginia and Maryland, but resident voters elect a mayor and the City Council.

James Kariuki, the U.K.’s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan “will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.” Israel’s restrictions on accessing Gaza have forced countries to take to the skies, but doctors on the ground warn aid drops are “causing havoc.” are “causing havoc.” An NBC News analysis of satellite imagery and social media videos reveals Israel’s network of buffer zones outside its borders with Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. “Governor Abbott is the joke,” Pritzker, a Democrat, told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that aired Sunday in response to Abbott calling Illinois’ congressional map a “joke.” “He’s the one who is attempting mid-decade here — at a time when, frankly, all of us are concerned about the future of democracy.

Article: Netanyahu defends Israel's plan to seize Gaza City, despite global condemnation toggle caption Abir Sultan/AFP via Getty Images Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that his plan to seize control of Gaza City and the remaining sliver of Gaza not already under Israeli control will involve displacing the population and taking control of the entire Gaza Strip. Sponsor Message The families of hostages held in Gaza are also denouncing the move, demanding Netanyahu's government strike a ceasefire deal with Hamas that frees the 50 or so hostages still held by militants, around 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. "Contrary to false claims, this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily," he said in his first public comments since Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan. He said Israel will do so by enabling people "to safely leave the combat areas to designated safe zones." He said that there they would be given "ample food, water and medical care." He did not say how Gaza's population of 2 million people would be moved to these areas safely, where these zones would be, if they would be encircled by Israeli troops or any other details on the plan.

He spoke to reporters as he stood before pictures of famished children in Gaza with the words "fake" on them, claiming there was no starvation and that such reports are "malignant lies." NPR's own reporting, experts on famine and visiting physicians on the ground have all confirmed severe malnutrition and starvation among the population. "Hospitals are not protected, doctors have been killed or detained, and facilities are working without sufficient medical supplies." In less than two years of war, Israeli strikes have killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Nearly 1,800 people have been killed and nearly 13,000 wounded while trying to get food aid in the last few weeks, most killed by Israeli forces, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

On Sunday, foreign affairs ministers from Spain, Portugal, Norway and other European countries signed a joint letter bashing Israel's plan, saying it would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, endanger the remaining hostages and "lead to an unacceptable high toll of deaths and the forced displacement of nearly one million Palestinian civilians." Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey also condemned Israel's plan. interim ambassador to the U.N., said during the Security Council meeting Sunday that "Israel has a right to decide what is necessary for its security, and what measures are appropriate to end the threat posed by Hamas and other similar groups." Sponsor Message Shea added: "The simple truth is that this war could end today if Hamas would let the hostages and all of Gaza go free." Netanyahu's office said on Sunday that the prime minister spoke to President Trump about the plan to seize control of Gaza City and thanked Trump "for his steadfast support for Israel since the start of the war." Last week, when asked about a possible plan by Israel to occupy all of Gaza, Trump said that was "pretty much up to Israel."

Article: -- A Colorado prison was evacuated as one of the largest wildfires in state history continued to grow, and officials warned residents of remote areas to be ready to leave Sunday as gusty winds and low humidity fed the flames. Evacuation orders were already in place for mountain communities as the Lee Fire charred more than 167 square miles (433 square kilometers) across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties, with just 6% containment. The Lee Fire, churning through trees and brush about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Denver, is now the sixth-largest single fire in the state’s history, according to the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. In Southern California, crews reached 62% containment on the 8-square-mile (20-square-kilometer) Canyon Fire that forced evacuations and destroyed seven structures after breaking out Thursday near the Los Angeles County and Ventura County line. The Gifford Fire, California's largest blaze so far this year, has scorched at least 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on Aug.

Article: Bob died on Sunday morning – peacefully, according to a Facebook update shared by Lisa Johnson Mitchell, the director of His Name is Bob, the appropriately named 2010 documentary that attempted to decipher his widespread lore. So often throughout the ’10s, he’d inexplicably appear on a rock club stage, smiling and hoisting his keyboard in the air as a touring indie rock outfit warmly welcomed his presence and played on around him to the cheers of the knowing local crowd. Even more commonly, at the bleary-eyed end of the night, after banging out a few melodies to anyone who'd listen he could be found along the sidewalks of Elm Street, pleading with familiar faces to give him a ride to his place. After being introduced to the crowd by one of the area’s patrol cops, Hall spoke for a few minutes, promising the dozens in attendance that her department was taking their concerns seriously and laying out some vague plans she was working to address the issues. Actually, he had less of a question than a statement; Bob wanted the chief to know that he felt he was having too tough a time lately waving down bartenders to bring him a soda — preferably a Dr Pepper, if at all possible.

Article: The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow’s uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia’s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit. WATCH: Trump will meet with Putin in Alaska for talks on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has stood firm in his positions, agreeing to a ceasefire proposed by Trump while reaffirming the country’s refusal to abandon seeking NATO membership and rejecting acknowledgment of Russia’s annexation of any of its regions. Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.” A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve: Russia’s position In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a “package proposal” for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. READ MORE: Zelenskyy rejects Trump’s suggestion of ceding Ukrainian territory to end war with Russia Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian — conditions reflecting Putin’s earliest goals. Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven’t been any shifts in the Russian position. It reaffirmed Ukraine’s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance. Although Trump expressed disappointment with Putin, his agreement to meet him without Zelenskyy at the table raised worries in Ukraine and its European allies, who fear it could allow the Russian to get Trump on his side and strong-arm Ukraine into concessions. Trump said without giving details that “there’ll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine as part of any peace deal that he will discuss with Putin when they meet Friday. WATCH: Trump suggests ‘swapping’ Ukraine and Russia territories ahead of meeting with Putin Putin repeatedly warned Ukraine will face tougher conditions for peace if it doesn’t accept Moscow’s demands as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for the territories of the four annexed by Moscow still under Ukrainian control. “That is potentially a situation that gives Putin a tremendous amount of leeway as long as he can use that leverage to force the Ukrainians into a deal that they may not like and to sideline the Europeans effectively,” Sam Greene of King’s College London said. “The question is, will Trump sign up to that and will he actually have the leverage to force the Ukrainians and the Europeans to accept it?” Putin could accept a temporary truce to win Trump’s sympathy as he seeks to achieve broader goals, Greene said. “He understands that his only route to getting there runs via Trump.” In a possible indication he thinks a ceasefire or peace deal could be close, Putin called the leaders of China, India, South Africa and several ex-Soviet nations in an apparent effort to inform these allies about prospective agreements. “However these conditions are worded, they amount to the same demand: Ukraine stops resisting, the West halts arms supplies, and Kyiv accepts Russia’s terms, which effectively amount to a de facto capitulation,” she posted on X. It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.” She predicted Putin might agree to meet Zelenskyy but noted the Kremlin leader would only accept such a meeting “if there is a prearranged agenda and predetermined outcomes, which remains difficult to imagine.” “The likely scenario is that this peace effort will fail once again,” she said.

Heather Hamilton, who snorkels off the coast of Cornwall virtually every week with her father David, has swum through large blooms of salps, a species that looks a bit like a jellyfish. "It just felt very kind of out of this world, something I've never seen before."

Some exceptional sea temperatures have also been detected by measurement buoys off the UK coast, known as WaveNet and run by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). The Met Office says its data from the end of June 2024 to now is provisional and will be finalised in the coming months, but this usually results in only very minor changes. "All the way through the year, on average it's been warmer than we've really ever seen [for the UK's seas]," said Prof John Pinnegar, the lead adviser on climate change at Cefas.

"This is the kind of fire that is really driven in part by the significant drought-stressed fuels that are out there," says Bethany Urban, a fire information officer with Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team 3.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) FILE - Shipping containers are loaded onto trucks at CSX Intermodal Terminals, a supplier of rail-based freight transportation, at CSX Queensgate Rail Yard, May 7, 2025, in Cincinnati. President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% last week, but a key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. “Canada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity.” ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.

Article: Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package FILE - Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Thursday, Feb. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package. The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO. At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.” Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting. Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajection of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S.

(Elizabeth Williams via AP) NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed. Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request. He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week. Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

Article: In this article Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group Corp., speaks at the SoftBank World event in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images Masayoshi Son is making his biggest bet yet: that his brainchild SoftBank will be the center of a revolution driven by artificial intelligence. Now, the billionaire is hoping to replicate that success with a series of investments and acquisitions in AI firms that will put SoftBank at the center of a fundamental technological shift. "I vividly remember the first time he invited me to his home for dinner and sitting on his porch over a glass of wine, he started talking to me about singularity – the point at which machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence," Alok Sama, a former finance chief at SoftBank until 2016 and and president until 2019, told CNBC. That may go some way to explain what has been an aggressive drive over the past few years — but especially the last two — to put SoftBank at the center of the AI story. While Arm blueprints form the basis of the designs for nearly all the world's smartphones, these days, the company is looking to position itself as a key player in AI infrastructure. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is another marquee investment for SoftBank, with the Japanese giant saying recently that planned investments in the company will reach about 4.8 trillion Japanese yen ($32.7 billion). "SoftBank's AI strategy is comprehensive, spanning the entire AI stack from foundational semiconductors, software, infrastructure, and robotics to cutting-edge cloud services and end applications across critical verticals such as enterprise, education, health, and autonomous systems," Neil Shah, co-founder at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. Son's vision is to cohesively connect and deeply integrate these components, thereby establishing a powerful AI ecosystem designed to maximize long-term value for our shareholders." Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon SoftBank's stock performance since 2017, the year that its first Vision Fund was founded. There is a common theme behind SoftBank's investments in AI companies that comes directly from Son — namely, that these firms should be using advanced intelligence to be more competitive, successful, to make their product better and their customers happy, a person familiar with the company told CNBC. Major tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Tesla boss Elon Musk are now talking about robotics as a key application of AI — but Son was thinking about this more than a decade ago. Two years later, the two companies launched a humanoid robot called Pepper, which they billed as "the world's first personal robot that can read emotions." Later, Son said: "In 30 years, I hope robots will become one of the core businesses in generating profits for the SoftBank group." SoftBank's bet on Pepper ultimately flopped for the company. But investments in Chinese technology companies and some bad bets on firms like WeWork soured sentiment for the Vision Fund as it racked up billions of dollars of losses by 2023. Vision but bad timing The market questioned some of Son's investments in companies like Uber and Didi, which were burning through cash at the time and had unclear unit economics. "When those companies came to head in 2021, 2022, Masa would have been in a perfect place but he had used all his ammunition on other companies," the former Vision Fund exec said. "When they came to age in 21, 22, the Vision Fund had invested in five or six hundred different companies and he was not in a position to invest in AI and he missed that." Son himself said this year that SoftBank wanted to invest in OpenAI as early as 2019, but it was Microsoft that ended up becoming the key investor.

Article: Al Jazeera Media Network condemns in the strongest terms the targeted assassination of its correspondents Anas Al Sharif and Mohammed Qraiqea, along with photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher, and Mohamed Nofal, by the Israeli occupation forces in yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom. In a statement by the Israeli occupation force, admitting to their crimes, the journalists were targeted by a directed assault towards the tent where they were stationed opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza. This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities. The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza. As Al Jazeera Media Network bids farewell to yet another group of its finest journalists, who boldly and courageously documented the plight of Gaza and its people since the onset of the war, it holds the Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists. Advertisement Despite losing several journalists to deliberate attacks and working under constant threat, Anas Al Sharif, Mohammed Qraiqea, and their colleagues persisted in the strip to ensure the world sees the harrowing truth experienced by Gaza’s populace. While vehemently condemning these heinous crimes and the ongoing attempts by Israeli authorities to silence the truth, Al Jazeera Media Network calls on the international community and all relevant organisations to take decisive measures to halt this ongoing genocide and end the deliberate targeting of journalists.

Article: The Israel Defense Forces said that it killed a man in Gaza who it claimed was posing as an Al Jazeera journalist, but the news network said that Anas al-Sharif was a journalist and that he and four other staff members were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike. The network reported that they died “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israel Defense Forces claimed that al-Sharif was "the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops." The IDF said in a statement about the killing that it had "previously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip" that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in a statement. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.” After an IDF spokesperson accused al-Sharif of being affiliated with Hamas' military wing in July, al-Sharif told the CPJ that he was being retaliated against for news coverage that made Israel look bad.

Article: As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations “are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.” "It’s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,” she said. Trump is having an enduring impact on the federal courts Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. “The Democrats’ extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump’s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.” Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. Challenging abortion care, medication, Planned Parenthood In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” — Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution’s protections for religious freedom. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a “barbaric practice” and “one of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable” in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. — Joshua Divine, a deputy solicitor general of Missouri who is nominated to be a district judge in the state, is currently representing Missouri in a case challenging the FDA approval of mifepristone. Divine co-authored the lawsuit, which includes misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb.” In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a “zealot" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as “the killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being” and argued that life begins at fertilization. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion. Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life, said she was hopeful the administration will continue nominating those “who will respect the rule of law.” Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time. Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said the courts, until now, have largely been an effective option for advocates to challenge state abortion bans and restrictions. “This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion — saying he’s going to leave it to the states while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," she said.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. ATLANTA — A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation. A union representing workers at the CDC said the incident was not random and “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured." It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk. Here's what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation: Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was “complex” and the investigation would take “an extended period of time." The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.” Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release. is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through "his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust.” Kennedy reached out to staff on Saturday, saying “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the campus. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff. White's father, who contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter, said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official. A neighbor of White told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.

King, Muddy Waters and all of them,” he tells The Associated Press over the phone, “I do the best I can to keep the blues alive.” He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons “Ain't Done with the Blues” is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten — like on the album closer “Talk to Your Daughter,” a rendition of the J.B. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of “Sinners.” Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, describes the current moment as a “resurgence of the blues,” following “Sinners.” “Several artists featured on the film’s soundtrack, which includes works from real-life blues, folk and country musicians, saw spikes the week of the film’s theatrical release,” he explains. “They ain’t never gonna come in and say, ‘I heard it on the radio.’” That's part of the reason why Guy decided to participate in the movie in the first place. “I hope this will give the blues a boost, because my worry right now is, like I said, a young person don’t know how good a gumbo is — you’ve got to taste it.” For now, he's excited to see how people respond to his new album, “Ain't Done with the Blues” — but he's not listening to it.

Defendants include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office and the county board of commissioners. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor recently spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego’s Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.

Article: Australia said Monday that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing list of Western governments making the move as Israel becomes increasingly isolated over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” he said at a news conference after a cabinet meeting in Canberra. Though largely symbolic, they indicate a broader global shift against Israel’s policies in Gaza, where the United Nations and others say people are dying of malnutrition and starvation after months of limited or nonexistent aid. Albanese said Australia’s position was predicated on the commitments it had received from the Palestinian Authority, including that there would be no role for Hamas in any future Palestinian state.

Article: Lucy Letby: How the case of one baby death shows flaws in the medical evidence on both sides 18 minutes ago Share Save Jonathan Coffey BBC Panorama Share Save BBC When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Panorama Barrister Mark McDonald says his panel of leading experts found no evidence that any babies were deliberately harmed Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was "unlikely" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. "But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation." Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in pre-term babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Reuters In many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. Andy Rain/ EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Professor Neena Modi believes there is some postmortem evidence of air embolism but this is likely to have occurred during resuscitation (pictured far left, with Professor Shoo Lee far right) To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder." The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: "Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time." Julia Quenzler / BBC The needle theory was examined at length during Lucy Letby's trial It was a bombshell claim. One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver." Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his "opinion has not substantially changed". Lack of consensus among the experts The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Panorama Dr Mike Hall, Letby's original defence expert, says there is no record of a traumatic delivery in Baby O's medical notes However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know." The insulin evidence For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning.

Article: So these Ukrainian children spend summer together 42 minutes ago Share Save Will Vernon BBC News in Ukraine Share Save BBC Children comfort each other as they share their experiences of the war The day Russia's full-scale invasion began, Dima's dad told him he might never see him again. Dad said, 'I'm going to do everything I can so that you can live a normal life.'" Days later, Dima's father had joined the military and left for the front line. "Many of these children have multiple traumas because not only are their fathers missing, but some of them have uncles and grandmothers missing too," explains Vanui Martirosyan, lead psychologist at the charity. And we cannot work with them like with children with actual loss, because they do not have this point of starting grieving." She says many of the children spend hours trawling Russian social media channels, desperately searching for information about their family members. This type of trauma is maybe the most difficult to work with." The day after the campfire meeting, I speak to Dima, who wants to tell me more about his dad. I realised I wouldn't see my dad for a while." For many of the children the camp is an opportunity to escape the constant threat of missile strikes During all our interviews with the children, including with Dima, a Gen.Ukrainian psychologist was present. Then another soldier who was at Dad's position said they saw him dead, with shrapnel wounds to the head." Dima says the effect on both him and his mother was profound. "When Dad left, he said, 'Dima, no matter what happens you must look after Mum because you're a man, and you're her son."' Group therapy at the camp takes place daily, held in small rooms. One seven-year-old boy, Zahar, tells me his painting is called "Daddy comes home." It shows yellow stick men in front of a blue sky - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. "I love him very much and I know he loves me too," she continues, adding, "I hope we can make new memories with him again." This camp also offers the kids a chance to catch up on sleep, uninterrupted by air-raid sirens - and to just have fun and play.

Article: South Korea military shrinks by 20% due to low birthrate South Korea's military has fallen below the 500,000 threshold that experts say is needed to maintain defence readiness A study published by South Korean researchers in July had suggested that the country would need at least 500,000 soldiers to defend against an attack from the North, which is believed to have 1.3 million active-duty members. According to the defense ministry report on Sunday, the number of divisions in South Korea's military has dropped from 59 to 42 since 2006 - with the units either disbanded or merged with one another. The country has repeatedly broken its own record for having the world's lowest birth rate: 0.98 babies per woman in 2018, 0.84 in 2020, 0.72 in 2023 and 0.75 in 2024.

In May, new regulations went into effect that eased migrants’ ability to obtain residency and work permits, and the Spanish Parliament began debating a bill to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants. Last year the national birthrate was 1.4, the second lowest in the European Union and well below the 2.1 threshold needed to maintain the country’s population level of around 48 million people. The push for the undocumented immigrants’ amnesty did not originate with the government, tellingly, but with a popular petition that garnered 600,000 signatures and was endorsed by 900 nongovernmental organizations, business groups and even the Spanish Conference of Bishops.

His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a "humanitarian catastrophe." Australia's government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. "A two-state solution is humanity's best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza," Albanese said. "The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children." Ahead of Albanese's announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state.

Boluarte arrived in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta on Sunday afternoon, following an invitation President Prabowo extended when the two leaders met at the APEC Summit in Peru in November 2024. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. The two leaders are expected to witness the signing of CEPA that could be a major booster to bilateral trade, said Indonesia’s trade minister Budi Santoso ahead of the visit. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” Santoso said, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry’s data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File) FILE - Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., delivers his State of the Nation Address at the House of Representatives in Quezon City, Philippines, on July 28, 2025. said Monday his country would inevitably be drawn “kicking and screaming” into any war over Taiwan due to its proximity to the self-ruled island and the presence of large numbers of Filipino workers there, despite China’s strong protest over such remarks. Marcos also told a news conference that the Philippines' coast guard, navy and other vessels defending its territorial interests in the South China Sea would never back down and would stand their ground in the contested waters after the Chinese coast guard on Monday staged dangerous blocking maneuvers and used a powerful water cannon to try to drive away Philippine vessels from the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal. It’s the latest flare-up of long-simmering territorial disputes in the busy waterway, a key global trade route, where overlapping claims between China and the Philippines have escalated in recent years. Relations between China and the Philippines have been severely strained after Marcos, who took office in mid-2022, and his administration emerged as some of the most vocal critics in Asia of China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. The Marcos administration deepened its treaty alliance engagements with the United States and started broadening security alliances with other Western and Asian countries like Japan, Australia, India and some EU member states to strengthen deterrence against Beijing’s assertiveness. China protested last week and accused Marcos of interfering in its domestic affairs and violating its “One China” policy when he told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to India that there was no way the Philippines could stay out of a possible war in Taiwan because of his country’s proximity to it and the presence of about 200,000 Filipino workers on the self-ruled island. The Chinese Foreign Ministry then said through a spokesperson that “'geographic location' and a ‘large volume of Filipinos’ in Taiwan should not be used as pretexts to interfere in the internal and sovereign affairs of other countries” and urged the Philippines “to earnestly abide by the One China principle” and “refrain from playing fire on issues bearing on China’s core interests.” Asked to comment on China’s protest, Marcos said he was perplexed and could not understand Beijing’s concern. We do not want to go to war, but I think if there is a war over Taiwan, we will be drawn, we will be pulled in whether we like it or not, kicking and screaming,” Marcos said. I hope it doesn’t happen, but, if it does, we have to plan for it already.” Separately, Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said Chinese coast guard ships chased and staged dangerous blocking maneuvers on Monday against Philippine coast guard and fishing vessels in the Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing atoll in the South China Sea off the northwestern Philippines.

Following the latest bilateral meeting in Stockholm in July, Beijing had struck an optimistic tone, saying that both sides would work toward extending the tariff truce by another 90 days. In May, the two sides agreed to a 90-day tariff truce that reduced duties the prohibitive 145% in April while also pausing a series of punitive measures, allowing room for further negotiation to reach a lasting deal. but by no means a friendlier one," said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, noting that both sides are "structurally heading more toward decoupling as a consequence of the new global trade and geopolitical environment." Purchase agreement, transshipment Despite the tariff truce, trade between the Washington and Beijing has been hit substantially. In a post on Truth Social Sunday night stateside, Trump said he hoped China to "quickly quadruple its soybean orders." China has ramped up soybean purchases in recent months, with imports volumes growing 36.2%, 10.4% and 18.4% in May, June and July, respectively, according to Wind Information. Trade experts have warned that exports — a critical growth driver for China's economy — could slow down in the coming months as Trump levies a blanket 40% tariff on goods routed through third-party countries, although providing little clarity over how those shipments would be defined. and China on semiconductor export controls have also escalated in recent weeks, even as Nvidia plans to resume sales of its H20 chip to China, reversing export controls on H20 sales imposed by Trump in April.

Article: Legendary Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter dies at 92 19 minutes ago Share Save Share Save BBC Long-serving Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter, who turned the children's show into a television institution, has died at the age of 92. "My friends and I held bring-and-buy sales for the Spitfire fund and put on plays and concerts for the British Red Cross and Aid to France." She was keen to introduce pets to the programme She was educated at a local grammar school before going to St Mary's College, Durham University in 1952. I do hope it's better.' It's only a tiny thing, but children aren't stupid." Baxter later estimated that 75% of the show's content was based on ideas submitted by its audience. "Her life was that show." he recalled "Without that obsessional talent, the programme would never have maintained the quality that it did.” Stiletto heels The iconic Blue Peter annuals began to appear with their mixture of entertaining but also informative articles. But while the presenters were the public face of Blue Peter there was never any doubt about who ran the show and most of her team were in awe of her. Baxter in a rare public appearance on the Blue Peter set One studio manager recalled that her habit of striding across the studio in stiletto heels damaged the floor but no-one had the courage to tell her. Peter Purves, who joined Blue Peter as a presenter in 1967 recalled: "This woman controlled our lives, and she didn't do it very nicely." Valerie Singleton complained she treated presenters like children. "How can you have a Blue Peter presenter on commercial television advertising dog food so children think, 'I must buy this.'" Children were encouraged to contribute ideas for the programme In the event, Noakes did the adverts with a lookalike dog. At the time, it was reported that she decided to leave when her husband, the musicologist John Hosier, was offered a job in China and she decided to go with him. But Richard Marson - her colleague-turned-biographer - insisted that she was was "manoeuvred out in the summer of 1988 by a new head of children’s programmes who wanted the show to evolve without its all-powerful matriarch." She was devastated, but did not complain in public.

The 52-strong German High Seas fleet was scuttled - deliberately sunk - by its crews in 1919 when the commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, mistakenly thought peace talks had failed. Orkney Islands Council, which has been pushing for historic MPA status for many years, assessed that the wrecks were vulnerable and there was a risk of losing "features of historical importance."

Article: Late in the summer of 2021, Greer Jarrett set out on the first of 26 voyages to retrace the maritime paths taken by Norse sailors during the Viking Age, which lasted from roughly A.D. The Vikings, beyond their reputation as medieval bad boys — Pillage People, if you will — were accomplished traders who established commercial routes that stretched all the way to Baghdad. Jarrett, a doctoral candidate in archaeology at Lund University in Sweden, was intrigued not only by where these ancient mariners started and wound up, but also the paths they took to get there. Most of the journeys were undertaken in 30-foot fyringer, square-rigged, open clinker boats, built in the tradition of Afjord, a small Norwegian municipality where Viking-era boatbuilding techniques endured into the 20th century.

(AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File) SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act “fail as a matter of law.” They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

Article: Security footage from a hospital in Sweida in southern Syria shows what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb This is a locator map for Syria with its capital, Damascus. (AP Photo) DAMASCUS, Syria -- Footage from security cameras at a hospital in the city of Sweida in southern Syria published Sunday showed what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb. The video published by activist media collective Suwayda 24 was dated July 16, during intense clashes between militias of the Druze minority community and armed tribal groups and government forces. A Syrian government official said they could not immediately identify the attackers in the video, and are investigating the incident to try to figure out if they are government-affiliated personnel or gunmen from tribal groups. Abdul Qader Al-Tahhan was assigned to oversee the investigation "to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and arrested as quickly as possible.” “We condemn and denounce this act in the strongest terms, and we affirm that the perpetrators will be held accountable and brought to justice to receive their just punishment, regardless of their affiliations," the statement said. The incident at the Sweida National Hospital further exacerbates tensions between the Druze minority community and the Syrian government, after clashes in July between Druze and armed Bedouin groups sparked targeted sectarian attacks against them. Though the fighting has largely calmed down, government forces have surrounded the southern city and the Druze have said that little aid is going into the battered city, calling it a siege. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which has organized aid convoys into Sweida, said in a statement on Saturday that one of those convoys that was carrying aid in the day before “came under direct fire,” and some of its vehicles were damaged. It called for the government to “ensure credible, swift, transparent, impartial, and comprehensive investigations.” The statement also reiterated “obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transportation and equipment, as well as hospitals and medical facilities.” It expressed concern about "foreign terrorist fighters" in Syria, while calling on “all states to refrain from any action or interference that may further destabilize the country,” an apparent message to Israel, which intervened in last month's conflict on the side of the Druze, launching airstrikes on Syrian government forces.

Article: Joy Falatiya says she fell apart after her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in South Sudan in March 2024 People participate in a Self Help Plus session at St. (AP Photo/Florence Miettaux) MUNDRI, South Sudan -- Joy Falatiya said her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in March 2024 and that she fell apart after that. She told The Associated Press that her suicidal thoughts are now gone after months of psycho-social therapy, even though she still struggles to feed her children and can’t afford to keep them in school. ___ The clinic is in one of eight locations chosen for a project that aimed to provide mental health services for the first time to over 20,000 people across this East African country. Across South Sudan, there has been massive displacement of people in the civil war that began in 2013 when government troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fought those loyal to Vice President Riek Machar. to warn of a possible “relapse into large scale conflict.” The violence persists even today, with Machar under house arrest and government forces continuing with a campaign to weaken his ability to wage war. And poverty — over 90% of the country's people live on less than $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank — is rampant in many areas, adding to the mental health pressures many people face, according to experts. In South Sudan, suicide affects mostly the internally displaced, fueled by confinement and pressures related to poverty, idleness, armed conflict, and gender-based violence, according to the International Organization for Migration. "So the burden for the individuals, their families and their communities is huge in this country, and it has gone quite unaddressed so far.” Last month, authorities in Juba raised an alarm after 12 cases of suicide were reported in just a week in the South Sudan capital. Atong Ayuel Longar, one of South Sudan’s very few psychiatrists and the leader of the mental health department at the health ministry, said a pervasive sense of “uncertainty is what affects the population the most" amid the constant threat of war. Things are getting tough." In Mundri, the AP visited several mental health facilities in June and spoke to many patients, including women who have recently lost relatives in South Sudan's conflict. As one of the charities seeking to expand mental health services, the Catholic non-governmental organization Caritas organizes sessions of Self Help Plus, a group-based stress management course launched by WHO in 2021. Longar, the psychiatrist, said she believes the community must be equipped with tools “to heal and to help themselves by themselves, and break the cycle of trauma." But she worries about whether such support can be kept sustainable as funds continue to dwindle, reflecting the retreat by the United States from its once-generous foreign aid program. The project that may have helped save Falatiya's life, funded until November by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation and the Athens-based Stavros Niarchos Foundation, will come to an end without additional donor funding. “What happened to me in the past was very dangerous, but the thought of bad things can be removed,” Falatiya said, surveying a garden she cultivates outside her small home where a local man has allowed her to stay after taking pity on her.

The Metropolitan Police Service released the updated figures as protesters demanding the immediate release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza held their own march through central London on Sunday afternoon. Backers of Palestine Action staged the protest to underscore their belief that the government is illegally restricting freedom of expression by banning a direct action organization that has challenged its policies. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who oversees law enforcement in Britain, rejected that characterization, saying Palestine Action was banned after committing serious attacks involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage. “The right to protest is one we protect fiercely but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organization,” Cooper said in a statement. Police said the process of deciding whether to file charges against those arrested is likely to take weeks as officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command put together case files and seek approval from prosecutors, and in some cases the attorney general.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez, file) Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said at a news conference in Canberra. Speaking a day after the protest, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that “there is a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognise.” “In relation to recognition, I’ve said for over a year now, it’s a matter of when, not if,” Wong added. The opposition Liberal Party criticised the move, saying it put Australia at odds with the United States, its closest ally, and reversed a bipartisan consensus that there should be no recognition while Hamas remains in control of Gaza. “Despite his words today, the reality is Anthony Albanese has committed Australia to recognising Palestine while hostages remain in tunnels under Gaza and with Hamas still in control of the population of Gaza. Advertisement “Recognising a Palestinian state prior to a return of the hostages and defeat of Hamas, as the Government has today, risks delivering Hamas one of its strategic objectives of the horrific terrorism of October 7.” The Australian Greens, the fourth-largest party in parliament, welcomed the move to recognise Palestine, but said the announcement did not meet the “overwhelming calls from the Australian public for the government to take material action”. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) also criticised the announcement, describing it as a “political fig leaf, letting Israel’s genocide and apartheid continue unchallenged, and distracting from Australia’s complicity in Israeli war crimes via ongoing weapons and components trade”. These “detailed and significant commitments” include the PA reaffirming it “recognises Israel’s right to exist in peace and security” and committing to “demilitarise and to hold general elections”, Albanese said while announcing the decision. Albanese said the commitments secured by Australia were “an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all”. New Zealand to decide on recognition next month Meanwhile, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Monday that his country’s cabinet will make a formal decision on Palestinian statehood in September. “Ultimately, New Zealand has an independent foreign policy, and on this issue, we intend to weigh up the issue carefully and then act according to New Zealand’s principles, values and national interest.” Peters said that while New Zealand has for some time considered the recognition of a Palestinian state a “matter of when, not if”, the issue is not “straightforward” or “clear-cut”. Over the next month, we look forward to canvassing this broad range of views before taking a proposal to Cabinet.” Of the UN’s 193 member states, 147 already recognise Palestinian statehood, representing some three-quarters of the world’s countries and the vast majority of its population. The announcements by Australia and New Zealand on Monday came hours after an Israeli attack killed five Al Jazeera staff members in Gaza City, and as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to threaten a full-scale invasion of the city in the north of the Gaza Strip.

Article: Trump demands homeless people 'immediately' move out of Washington DC Trump signed an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people, and he last week ordered federal law enforcement into the streets of Washington DC. US President Donald Trump has said homeless people must "move out" of Washington DC as he vowed to tackle crime in the city, but the mayor pushed back against the White House likening the capital to Baghdad. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The specifics of the president's plan are not yet clear, but in a 2022 speech he proposed moving homeless people to "high quality" tents on inexpensive land outside cities, while providing access to bathrooms and medical professionals. On Friday, Trump ordered federal agents - including from US Park Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the US Marshals Service - into Washington DC to curb what he called "totally out of control" levels of crime. "We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low." She criticised White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for dubbing the US capital "more violent than Baghdad". But federal data from January suggests that Washington DC last year recorded its lowest overall violent crime figures - once carjacking, assault and robberies are incorporated - in 30 years. In another post on Sunday he said the event at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT) would address ending "crime, murder and death" in the city, as well as its "physical renovation". Community Partnership, an organisation that works to reduce homelessness in Washington DC, told Reuters news agency that the city of 700,000 residents had about 3,782 people homeless on any given night.

He is transferring 100% ownership of the family-owned business to an employee trust which means staff will get a share of the profits and a say in how the firm is run. "If the business had been sold just for money that would not have been passing on the baton in the way in which the family would have wanted," Mr Grant told the BBC. "That's when I think the staff will start to see something a little bit more meaningful." Under an employee ownership trust, Mr Grant and his family will be financially rewarded, too. The Entertainer Gary Grant started the toy chain with one shop in 1981 "The Entertainer has thrived against all the odds," says Mr Grant, listing the financial crisis of 2008, the Covid pandemic, the decline of the High Street and the shift to online. The Entertainer Gary Grant pictured in 1981 in his first toy shop Two of their four children work in the company but Mr Grant says they have got "other plans for their lives" and after lengthy succession planning, which explored a number of exit options, the family chose an employee ownership trust.

He told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster (GMU) programme that the man asked Fr Murray if he would hear his confession just before the morning service was due to start and "it was at that stage that he was attacked". 'Difficult to comprehend' Fr Murray was due to celebrate Mass at St Patrick's Church Fr McGee said Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, went to the hospital on Sunday night to meet with the family of Fr Murray and some of the clergy went to see the family of the man who has been killed. Fr McGee described Fr Murray as "very well known" and "very well respected priest" of the diocese who had been appointed a canon by the bishop in recognition for his work as a senior adviser. Fr Martin Graham, who took the service, said it was about being with the parishioners and praying with them, for Fr Murray and also "for the other poor man who lost his life". "It is just heartbreaking for them in what was supposed to be a poignant farewell this morning that it turned into something which was just grotesque." Sinn Fein councillor Oonagh Hanlon, who attended the vigil, described it as a "very sombre and very respectful" event which also remembered the man who was killed.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Ukrainian servicemen of the 148th artillery brigade load ammunition into a M777 howitzer before firing towards Russian positions at the frontline in Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on Thursday, Aug. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) DONETSK REGION, Ukraine -- In a dugout where each nearby blast sends dirt raining from the ceiling and the black plastic lining the walls slipping down, Ukrainian soldiers say peace talks feel distant and unlikely to end the war. President Donald Trump that there will be some " swapping of territories” — as well as media reports that it would involve Ukrainian troops leaving the Donetsk region where they have fought for years defending every inch of land — have stirred confusion and rejection among the soldiers. “At minimum, the result would be to stop active fighting — that would be the first sign of some kind of settlement,” said soldier Dmytro Loviniukov of the 148th Brigade. When direct talks between Russia and Ukraine were held in Istanbul in May, the soldiers from 148th brigade read the news with cautious hope, said a soldier with the call sign Bronson, who once worked as a tattoo artist. President Donald Trump reportedly gave Russia's Vladimir Putin — one that has since vanished from the agenda amid talk of a meeting in Alaska — the Russian fire roared every minute for hours. No one else will come here to defend us.” Dozens of kilometers from Zaporizhzhia region, north to the Donetsk area, heavy fighting grinds on toward Pokrovsk — now the epicenter of fighting. If we’re here, we need to cover our brothers in arms.” For Serhii Filimonov, commander of the “Da Vinci Wolves” battalion of the 59th brigade, the war’s end is nowhere in sight, and current news doesn’t influence the ongoing struggle to find enough resources to equip the unit that is fighting around Pokrovsk. The big question is what security guarantees we get — and how we hit pause." A soldier with the call sign Mirche from the 68th brigade said that whenever there is a new round of talks, the hostilities intensify around Pokrovsk — Russia’s key priority during this summer’s campaign.

Article: SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo — traditionally dependent on snow sports — are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists. “We used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,” said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president. Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. “The weather here is fantastic — it's not hot at all," said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week. The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years. Vasilije Knezevic, who leads quad tours of Jahorina’s highest peaks, noted that while the ski season was “bleak” because of the snow shortage, they are “having a fabulous summer so far.” Business might be growing in the mountains of Sarajevo, but it remains far less profitable than seaside destinations in neighboring Croatia, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of the country’s gross domestic product. Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik’s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders. While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to “extend the season” and become “year-round tourist destination,” in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.

Article: Kyiv, Ukraine – Taras, a seasoned Ukrainian serviceman recovering from a contusion, expects “no miracles” from United States President Donald Trump’s August 15 summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. “There’s going to be no miracles, no peace deal in a week, and Putin will try to make Trump believe that it is Ukraine that doesn’t want peace,” the fair-haired 32-year-old with a deep brown tan acquired in the trenches of eastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. Taras, who spent more than three years on the front line and said he had recently shot down an explosives-laden Russian drone barging at him in a field covered with explosion craters, withheld his last name in accordance with the wartime protocol. Putin wants to dupe Trump by pandering to the US president’s self-image as a peacemaker to avoid further economic sanctions, while the Russian leader seeks a major military breakthrough in eastern Ukraine, Taras said. “Putin really believes that until this winter, he will seize something sizeable, or that [his troops] will break through the front line and will dictate terms to Ukraine,” Taras said. As the Trump administration trumpets the upcoming Alaska summit as a major step towards securing a ceasefire, Ukrainians — civilians and military personnel — and experts are largely pessimistic about the outcomes of the meeting between the US and Russian presidents. Earlier this month, Russia intensified its push to seize key locations in the southeastern Donetsk region, ordering thousands of servicemen to conduct nearly-suicidal missions to infiltrate Ukrainian positions, guarded 24/7 by buzzing drones with night and thermal vision. Advertisement In the past three months, Russian forces have occupied some 1,500sq km (580 square miles), mostly in Donetsk, of which Russia controls about three-fourths, according to Ukrainian and Western estimates based on geolocated photos and videos. But Kyiv’s daring counteroffensive and Moscow’s inability to hold onto areas around the capital and in Ukraine’s north resulted in the loss of 9 percent of occupied lands by the fall of 2022. Russia has since re-occupied less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory, despite losing hundreds of thousands of servicemen, while pummelling Ukrainian cities almost daily with swarms of drones and missiles. Ukraine also controls a tiny border area in Russia’s western Kursk region, where it started a successful offensive in August 2024, but lost most of its gains earlier this year. In exchange, Moscow could offer a ceasefire and the freezing of the front line in other Ukrainian regions, as well as the retreat from tiny toeholds in Sumy and the northeastern Kharkiv region, according to the reports. But to give up Donetsk, Kyiv would have to vacate a “fortress belt” that stretches some 50km (31 miles) along a strategic highway between the towns of Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk. Donetsk’s surrender would “position Russian forces extremely well to renew their attacks on much more favorable terms, having avoided a long and bloody struggle for the ground,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said on Friday. Some civilian Ukrainians hold a gloomy view on the prospects of peace, believing that Kyiv’s tilt towards democracy and presumed eventual membership in the European Union, and Moscow’s “imperialistic nature” set up an equation that prevents a sustainable diplomatic solution. Advertisement “The war will go on until [either] Ukraine or Russia exist,” Iryna Kvasnevska, a biology teacher in Kyiv whose first cousin was killed in eastern Ukraine in 2023, told Al Jazeera. Despite Trump’s recent change in rhetoric and growing public dissatisfaction with Moscow’s reluctance to end the hostilities, the US president has a history of blaming Ukraine – for the war and its demands of its allies – while some of his negotiators have repeated Moscow’s talking points. It is also unclear whether Zelenskyy will be invited to a trilateral meet with Trump and Putin in Alaska, or whether the US will go ahead and seek to shape the future of Ukraine without Kyiv in the room. “Trump has let us down several times, and the people who believe he won’t do it again are very naive, if not stupid,” Leonid Cherkasin, a retired colonel from the Black Sea port of Odesa who fought pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk in 2014-2015 and suffered contusions, shrapnel and bullet wounds, told Al Jazeera. He referred to Trump’s pledges during his re-election campaign to “end the war in 24 hours”, and his ultimatums to impose crippling sanctions on Russia if Putin does not show progress in a peace settlement. Meanwhile, the very fact of a face-to-face with Trump heralds a diplomatic victory for Putin, who has become a political pariah in the West and faces child abduction charges that have led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant against him. “I think the deal will be limited to an agreement on cessation of air strikes, and Putin will get three months to finalise the land operations – that is, to seize the [entire] Donetsk region.” An air ceasefire may benefit Russia, as it can amass thousands of drones and hundreds of missiles for future attacks.

Article: Israel has assassinated Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif and four other staff in a targeted attack on a tent in Gaza City, taking the total number of journalists killed since October 7, 2023 to 269. Correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal were meeting in a media tent outside al-Shifa Hospital when they were targeted by a drone. “This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities,” the network said in a statement. “The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.” The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says it is “appalled” by Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalists. Since Israel launched its war on the enclave in October 2023, it has routinely accused Palestinian journalists in Gaza of being Hamas members, as part of what rights groups say is an effort to discredit their reporting of Israeli abuses.

British Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell in 1959 at the Admiralty Bay station - he was known for his love of the husky dogs "Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions," says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey . Dariusz Puczko The bones were found on the moraine and surface of the Ecology Glacier, on western shore of Admiralty Bay It was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959. David Bell, 86, spoke to BBC News from his home in Australia "One of the funniest things was, and I still can't get over this, one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema," David continues. "And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table," he says. Bell Dennis Bell is on the far right of the picture, celebrating Christmas in Antarctica in 1958 - seven months before he died Dennis Bell, nicked-named "Tink", was born in 1934. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Russell Thompson Men at the base on King George Island relied on sledges and dogs to get around the harsh terrain The British Antarctica Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and "ridiculously isolated" island. Reading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: "He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes." Russell Thompson Dennis Bell (on the left) was known for his sense of humour - he is re-enacting an advert on the snow in this picture Dennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions.

Due to Israel's military occupation, in the West Bank, the Palestinian authority, set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s, is not in full control of its land or people. Bettmann via Getty Images British troops lower the Union Flag to officially end British rule in Palestine in 1948 He went on to cite the 1917 Balfour Declaration - signed by his predecessor as foreign secretary Arthur Balfour - which first expressed Britain's support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". The phrase refers to the creation of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But international efforts to bring about a two-state solution have come to nothing and Israel's colonisation of large parts of the West Bank, illegal under international law, has turned the concept into a largely empty slogan. Australia has become the latest country to say it will recognise Palestinian Statehood at the next UN General Assembly in September - after similar announcements from France, Japan, Canada and the UK, on some conditions. If the UK and France do recognise a Palestinian state next month, Palestine would have the support of four of the UN Security Council's five permanent members - the other two being China and Russia. Successive British governments have talked about recognising a Palestinian state, but only as part of a peace process, ideally in conjunction with other Western allies and "at the moment of maximum impact". Health Secretary Wes Streeting summed up the views of many MPs when he urged the government to recognise Palestine "while there is still a state of Palestine left to recognise".

Article: Boston Public Library aims to increase access to a vast historic archive using AI toggle caption Aram Boghosian for Boston Public Library Boston Public Library, one of the oldest and largest public library systems in the country, is launching a project this summer with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to make its trove of historically significant government documents more accessible to the public. "It really is an incredible repository of primary source materials covering the whole history of the United States as it has been expressed through government publications," said Jessica Chapel, the Boston Public Library's chief of digital and online services. Researchers at the Harvard Law School Library's Institutional Data Initiative are working with libraries, museums and archives on a number of fronts, including training new AI models to help libraries enhance the searchability of their collections. (Microsoft and OpenAI are among the many AI players targeted by recent copyright infringement lawsuits, in which plaintiffs such as authors claim the companies stole their works without permission.)

Article: So far in fiscal year 2025, tariffs have accounted for 2.7% of federal revenues — a jump over past years that will almost certainly climb higher if tariffs remain in place. "Historically, tariff revenue has never accounted for more than about 2% of total federal government revenues in the modern era," said Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. "And with the tariffs that are in place today, that could go up to 5% or perhaps even higher." Should tariff revenue eventually climb to that 5% level — that's significant, but it's not big enough to fulfill some of Trump's more outlandish promises. "And the purpose of what I'm doing is primarily to pay down debt, which will happen in very large quantity." Sponsor Message Tariff revenue is a tiny fraction of the national debt Tariff revenue right now is a tiny fraction of that debt, which stands near $37 trillion. While the new tariff revenue is considerable, there's a good chance it won't cover new debt that this administration just added in the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law last month. toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP There are more tariffs to come — but limits on how much tariff revenue can grow It is true, of course, that Trump is continually adding new tariffs. So while there's more tariff revenue now, she told NPR, "that must be offset against the lower revenue we're bringing in in income, payroll and corporate taxes as a result of the economy growing at only half the rate it was forecast before the year started."

Article: Jena Ardell/Moment RF/Getty Images According to posts on TikTok, hormonal birth control can cause a nearly unlimited list of ailments: Depression, irreversible infertility, acne, destruction of the gut biome, weight gain, balding, and decreased libido to name a few. Sponsor Message Keep in mind, social media can skew accuracy of risk-benefit calculations when it comes to making decisions about birth control, says Emily Pfender, a researcher at University of Pennsylvania who has studied the way contraception is represented on social media. (Hormonal birth control methods have a failure rate of less than 1%, when used correctly.) " The old joke we used to say is that those that use natural family planning have naturally large families," says Dr. "But many of my patients have busy lives and this may not be the thing they want to focus on." Conti says one person's experience with these apps should not be predictive for others. "But telling you that this is the only way to do it is a very privileged approach because you're only considering your exact situation and scenario." The nuance Complaints about birth control get conflated with another, real issue – that women often feel overlooked in medical settings, says Pfender. "I did not know the risks," says Morris in the video, as she points to a picture of an X-ray where, she says, her IUD became embedded in her uterus. But Jensen says that in the short time clinicians often have with their patients, focusing on uncommon side effects may mean less time to focus on those that are more likely. With an IUD, for example, Jensen says, complications that require surgery are rare – one study suggested that for every 1,000 IUDs, between one and two result in "intrauterine migration," which can require surgery to remove, and this is often a minimally invasive procedure. Common side effects like irregular bleeding are more worthy of discussion, he says: "That's something that actually clinicians should do a much better job at focusing on." The bigger picture Clinicians stress the importance of weighing potential side effects of hormonal birth control against the risks of unplanned pregnancy. "Social media often gives no context around what exposure to pregnancy means to women." Maternal mortality rates have improved in the last century, but there are still significant health risks, says Jensen, as well as considerations of equality.

"Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people," the Qatari network said in a statement. International media have been mostly barred from entering Gaza throughout the war and Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside Gaza, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza and Brown University's Watson Institute in April said the war was "quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters." Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were "part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability."

Once the roads to the North Fork treatment plant had been rebuilt and an enormous bypass line replaced, there was the problem of turbidity, a measure of the particulates clouding a fluid. But as one problem was being solved, another emerged: The city announced that lead had been detected in the water at some elementary schools (which were, thankfully, still using bottled water). The public was terrified, especially after a chemist and a chemical engineer reached out separately to The Asheville Watchdog to warn that lead exposure could be more widespread than believed. But no matter how eagerly I combed Asheville and its environs for unglued ideas about the water, I found nothing beyond moderate skepticism at “superchlorination” and what seemed like more households storing emergency water supplies. I could not initially appreciate why so many of the residents policed these boundaries — why, for instance, it was important to many of those I interviewed that I lived in the area.

Article: President Donald Trump will hold a news conference Monday that he said "will, essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." The president promoted the news conference in multiple posts on his social media platform and on Sunday posted that it would "also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." In a separate post, Trump said the homeless should leave D.C., accompanied by photos of homeless encampments along his route from the White House to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." The news conference comes after Trump last week ordered an increase in law enforcement as part of an executive order he signed in March to "Make the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful." A White House official said the law enforcement effort a "whole of government approach to improve overall public safety" and said that law enforcement will "be focused on high traffic tourist areas and other known hotspots." The official added that federal officers "will be identified, in marked units, and highly visible." Trump said Sunday that he has given D.C. "The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. Bowser said Sunday that Washington has spent the last two years driving down violent crime, “driving it down to a 30 year low, in fact.” “It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023, this is 2025 and we've done that by working with the community, working with the police, working with our prosecutors, and, in fact, working with the federal government," Bowser told MSNBC. On Saturday, Trump said the nation’s capital has become “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” Last week he threatened to deploy the National Guard to D.C. And that also includes the graffiti that you see, the papers all over the place, the roads that are in bad shape, the medians that are falling down, the median in between roads, it's falling down,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. And that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last week, “Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long. President Trump is committed to making our Nation’s capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.” The seven-day law enforcement effort is being led by the U.S. Park Police but includes personnel from the Metro Transit Police Department, Amtrak Police Department, United States Capitol Police, Washington’s Metro Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Protective Service, Enforcement and Removal Operations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, United States Marshals Service, United States Attorney’s Office-District of Columbia, Department of Interior, Pre-Trial Services Agency, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), the White House official said.

In the meantime, economists say the talks — which take place as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine, with no ceasefire deal in sight — are already a win for Putin and his war-centered economy that is laboring under international sanctions and stubbornly high inflation of 9.4% in June. this is a weak economy," Portes told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition." Coming into talks with a strong position in the battlefield, Russia is likely to want immediate sanctions relief as part of any ceasefire deal, as well as Ukrainian territorial concessions. Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov on Saturday stated that "the economic interests of our countries intersect in Alaska and the Arctic, and there are prospects for implementing large-scale and mutually beneficial projects," the Kremlin stated. Portes said that if Trump "had the patience and the willingness to apply sanctions properly, then waiting [to hold talks] would result in a very significant change in the balance of forces." As things stand, however, Trump has mulled but so far held off on increasing sanctions on Russia. Washington has instead threatened the Kremlin's remaining trading partners, such as India, with "secondary sanctions" and additional trade tariffs for continuing with purchases of Russian oil, which have funded Moscow's war machine.

Article: But Paulson was shocked and flooded with memories when, just two weeks ago, he saw his former friend’s name in the headlines after police found the 34-year-old dead inside his Harlem apartment. Courtesy Joshua Baker When authorities entered the apartment on July 31 after Donald called for help, they found Jacob slumped over his toilet with a gash on his head and multiple stab wounds to the back of his leg, one deep enough to penetrate muscle, according to charging documents. In the days since his death, Paulson and seven others who knew Jacob spoke with NBC News as they slowly learned about the personal trainer’s life over the last decade. And while his fatal stabbing comes as a shock, those who knew Jacob believe Donald cut out his friends — and potential lifelines — years before he truly needed them. Paulson and Baker said that the trio never went “anywhere without each other” and spent endless days cooped up in Jacob’s Hell’s Kitchen apartment, which they say overlooked Central Park, playing video games, eating fried food, and daydreaming about their futures. A prominent New York City drag queen who uses they/them pronouns, Cummings said Jacob would frequently walk them between gigs late at night to make sure they got there safely. Jonathan Starkey, a friend from Texas, recalled that in one conversation around that time, Jacob said that “a lot had changed, and that Donald was a little possessive and jealous and kind of restricted who he was in touch with.” “Jacob wasn’t really someone who let people tell him what to do, which is why it’s so strange,” Starkey said. “He’s decided to break away from his past, which unfortunately included his closest friends, in order to move forward with a healthy life.” “He’s been very focused and is back on the right track in his life and in order to remain focused he will remain out of contact for the moment,” Donald added. For years, the only updates Jacob’s friends received about their friend came through social media, where images from the couple’s Instagrams showed what appeared to be a happy couple who traveled the world and lived a glamorous New York life. Prosecutors said in the charging documents filed after Jacob’s death that Donald had nine domestic incident reports filed against him since 2022, but did not provide more details about the nature of the incidents or who filed them. In November 2024, an order of protection was issued in New York County Criminal Court that directed Donald to cease communication and stay away from Jacob, according to charging documents associated with Donald’s arrest in February. The court records allege that Donald held a knife in Jacob’s direction and said, “I will attack you.” He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is still pending. When police arrived, they found Donald sitting on their couch with three cuts to his arm that later required stitches, a black eye, and bite marks, according to a criminal complaint. However, prosecutors say that Jacob called his father from the bathroom before the attack and allegedly told him that Donald “was coming at him with knives and preventing him from leaving the apartment,” according to the criminal complaint.

Article: It seems President Trump’s meeting with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, which included receiving a gold-and-glass statue from him at the White House last Wednesday, was not his most significant interaction with a top US exec that day. Yesterday, the Financial Times and the New York Times reported that POTUS also met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who offered to give the US 15% of revenue from selling AI chips to China in exchange for…the export licenses required to sell said chips to China. Heart of the deal Nvidia’s agreement revolves around its H20 AI chip, which has been in the news a lot: Nvidia specifically developed it for the Chinese market after President Biden introduced export controls in 2022 to keep more advanced US chips out of China. In July, the Trump administration announced it would allow Nvidia to sell the H20 to China again, but it didn’t grant the licenses for that until the end of last week. The Trump admin also banned exports of it to China in April, and it will receive export licenses again for the same terms, according to both the NYT and the FT. The Commerce Department, the White House, and AMD did not provide comment to the New York Times, but Nvidia Spokesperson Ken Brown told the outlet, “We hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” Big picture: After months of cutting deals with foreign nations about tariff rates for imports coming into the US, Trump negotiating for the government to share revenue with US companies for items going out is unprecedented.—HVL

Article: Ten years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision. Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees. In a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses. More fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was "egregiously wrong." "The mistake must be corrected," wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell "legal fiction." The petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, with son Nathan Davis, a deputy clerk, reads a statement to the media outside the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Ky., on September 14, 2015. Pablo Alcala/Lexington Herald-Leader/Tribune News Service via Getty Image "If there ever was a case of exceptional importance," Staver wrote, "the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it." Lower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk "cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect." Davis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention," said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News. A renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent Davis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy. So far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal. Scott Olson/Getty Images Support for equal marriage rights softening While a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020. The justices "should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell," Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights. "It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now," said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law. "It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement." Ruling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages If the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law. There are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Chief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as "an act of will, not legal judgment" with "no basis in the Constitution." He also warned then that it "creates serious questions about religious liberty." Davis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year.

Article: The plan follows a deliberate sequence: First destroy, then starve, occupy, demand demilitarisation, and finally carry out full ethnic cleansing once Palestinians have no political power and capacity to resist. On Sunday, the Israeli army assassinated Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa by dropping a missile on a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital. Advertisement The footage shocked viewers across the world and so the Israeli government was quick to ban filming on these flights, warning that aid drops would be halted if there were any violations. So before that day arrives, Israel is racing to erase the evidence because once the world sees Gaza, it will no longer be able to pretend that the war was about anything other than the mass killing of Palestinians and the erasure of their history. It has buried massacred civilians in mass graves with bulldozers; it has withheld bodies of Palestinian torture victims; it has dug into the sand whole crime scenes of execution; it has planted weapons in hospitals that it has ransacked; it has lied about discovering tunnels. Some of the documents that have disappeared give gruesome details about the brutality of Zionist fighters during massacres of Palestinians, like in the village of Dawaymeh, near Hebron, where hundreds of Palestinian men, women, and children were killed by artillery fire or directly executed. Journalists thus become mouthpieces for the Israeli military, parroting their justifications for wholesale destruction and propagating their lies about Palestinian civilians as “human shields” and Gaza hospitals and schools as “terror hubs”. Israel used this strategy early into the genocide, dropping leaflets warning Palestinians in northern Gaza that they will be deemed “partners in a terrorist organisation” if they do not comply with “evacuation orders”. Germany went as far as halting military exports that could be used in Gaza – something that should have been done 22 months ago, when Israel started indiscriminately bombing civilians. It must undertake military intervention, as mandated under international law, to force Israel to immediately end the violence, to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to give Palestinians the freedom they are entitled to.

Article: Below are a few of the responses to the killing of Al Jazeera staff: Palestine The Palestinian mission to the United Nations accused Israel of “deliberately assassinating” al-Sharif and Qreiqeh, describing them as among the “last remaining journalists” in Gaza. “As Israel continues to ethnically cleanse Gaza, its enemy remains the truth: the brave journalists exposing its heinous crimes.” Iran Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei has called on the world to hold Israel to account after the killing of the five Al Jazeera staff. “In Gaza, and everywhere, media workers should be able to carry out their work freely and without harassment, intimidation or fear of being targeted.” Al Jazeera Media Network Al Jazeera Media Network has condemned “in the strongest terms” the killing of its journalists in a targeted assassination by Israeli forces. The strike came amid what Al Jazeera described as the “catastrophic consequences” of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, including mass civilian deaths, forced starvation, and the destruction of entire communities. “This is part of a pattern … going back decades, in which it kills journalists.” Amnesty International Amnesty International condemned the strike as a war crime under international law and remembered al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter. At great risk to their lives, they have remained to show the world the war crimes being committed by Israel against almost two million Palestinian women, men and children,” he added. National Press Club Mike Balsamo, president of the US-based National Press Club, said the killing of journalists is “a loss felt far beyond one newsroom” and urged a “thorough and transparent” investigation. “All parties in conflict zones must honour their obligations under international law to protect reporters and ensure they can carry out their work safely.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned Israel’s killing of five Al Jazeera journalists and called on US and international media workers to “stand in solidarity” with their Palestinian colleagues. “The murder of these Al Jazeera journalists is not an accident or collateral damage – it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) — India ’s opposition parties held a protest Monday calling for the rollback of a controversial revision of the voter list in one of the country’s poorest states, where key elections are scheduled in November, and warning it could lead to voter disenfranchisement. Hundreds of lawmakers and supporters began the protest from parliament and were confronted by police, who stopped them from marching towards the election commission office in the capital, New Delhi. India's opposition accuses the Election Commission of India of rushing through a mammoth electoral roll revision in eastern Bihar state, saying the exercise could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. The revision of nearly 80 million voters involves strict documentation requirements from citizens, triggering concerns it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, especially those who are unable to produce the paperwork required to prove their citizenship. The election agency has denied the allegations and said it has ensured no eligible voter is “left behind." It has also said the “intensive revision” is a routine update to ensure the accuracy of electoral rolls and is needed to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants." According to the commission, some 49.6 million voters whose names were included in a similar exercise in 2003 are not required to submit any further documents. Modi's BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. Critics and opposition leaders have warned that the exercise is similar to that of a controversial 2019 citizenship list in India's eastern Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness. Gandhi, the opposition leader, made public last week his Congress Party's analysis from southern Karnataka state that alleged nearly 100,000 votes cast for an assembly seat in the 2024 general election were fraudulent.

Article: The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest maritime routes, which Beijing claims almost entirely despite an international ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. “The China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” Gan Yu, a Chinese coastguard spokesperson, said in a statement. “The [Chinese coastguard vessel] CCG 3104, which was chasing the [Philippine coastguard vessel] BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the [Philippine] vessel’s starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] Navy warship,” spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country’s patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend and exercise Manila’s sovereign rights over what it considers to be part of its territory. Marcos also addressed another source of tension with Beijing, stating China has “misinterpreted” his recent comments saying Manila would be inevitably drawn into a conflict between China and Taiwan should one erupt. China accused Marcos of “playing with fire” after the Philippine leader said during a visit to India that “there is no way that the Philippines can stay out of it” due to its proximity to Taiwan.

Article: A staff member for Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath emailed the county’s newly established Emergency Centralized Response Center, asking for a cleanup of a reoccurring homeless encampment along a rail line in the San Fernando Valley. Advertisement It was all in preparation for the day in late July when crews would arrive to the train tracks and throw away tarps and tents, and remove a makeshift electrical line residents set up to siphon power from the grid. County’s Emergency Centralized Response Center launched in January with a goal of better coordinating the various efforts among different government agencies and nonprofits to clean encampments, get people healthcare and into temporary or permanent housing. The dispatch center was established following a request from Supervisors Horvath and Kathryn Barger and is part of a larger stated effort to increase accountability and coordination when it comes to homeless services, including a new county homeless department that will launch next year. Advertisement In the supervisors’ motion requesting the response center, they said there previously wasn’t one entity tasked “to oversee and direct daily operations for unhoused individuals across Los Angeles County” — no small problem when different county departments, federal agencies, state agencies and 88 cities are involved. (David Butow/For The Times) When an encampment popped up, officials said multiple agencies would receive requests for service and then act on their own, resulting in multiple outreach teams dispatched to the same location, without knowledge someone else had been there before. Sometimes, a state agency would clean an encampment on its property, but not notify the local agency that owned the adjacent property, allowing residents to move their encampment there, said Donald Holt, principal analyst with ECRC. Now, the county says ECRC overseas more than 150 outreach teams across 11 organizations and coordinates with multiple government agencies that offer housing and conduct cleanups to ensure they are working together. “It wasn’t until this center came together that that coordination was really put into action in the ways we all expected.” Based in an office at the downtown Hall of Administration, center staff handle requests for service from elected officials, the public and government agencies and then coordinate cleanups and work to find housing, as well as needed medical care. (David Butow/For The Times) In addition to eight analysts dedicated to managing requests for specific regions of the county, workers at the center include staff from the county’s Housing for Health, Department of Mental Health, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the Department of Military & Veterans Affair, among others. “That would have taken me six hours.” Advertisement On a recent Tuesday, staff started the day in a meeting where they updated one another on requests for service, including instances where people were successfully moved into housing and others where the effort was still underway. (David Franco/County of Los Angeles) Shortly after the meeting, Chung’s supervisor Lisa Speights stopped by the cubicle of Maribel Lozano-Hernandez with the county’s Housing for Health program to discuss a housing request that came in within the last 24 hours. Three weeks ago , outreach workers from LA Family Housing, arrived to speak with residents, remind them of the following day’s cleanup and encourage them to sign forms to get into housing. (County of Los Angeles) Outreach workers had already been on site around five times and had already located housing options for some of the people living in roughly 10 tents and makeshift structures. Residents Jose Duran and his partner Melanie Morales said they moved onto the streets a few months ago when they couldn’t pay rent after Duran fell from a three story building and could no longer work construction. Speaking as trains zoomed past, Duran said after he fell from a ladder, his foot became infected and he received skin grafts to fix it, but still needs another surgery. According to a county spokesperson, workers removed “four makeshift shelters or tents and ten cubic yards of debris.” Duran and Morales weren’t housed that day and said they were told there wasn’t beds currently available. Rachel Kassenbrock, the county spokesperson, said on the day of the cleanup ten people from the encampment weren’t immediately able to be housed, but put on a wait list until beds became available, including Duran and Morales.

Article: For months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools. The morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.” Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom’s comments and legal threat. Advertisement The developments bring the fight over America’s higher education institutions — which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months — to the nation’s most powerful and lauded public university system. And what role will money — taxpayer money — play?” California is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls “Marxist” universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars. Advertisement His administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide — Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses — of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.” What’s at stake Since July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions — totaling nearly half a billion dollars — UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy. Advertisement UCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said. They hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations. The NSF letter said that UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.” What Trump wants Federal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations. The settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments. “It’s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words ‘UCLA.’ ” What comes next The 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC. Advertisement In an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were “clearly illegal” because “the president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.” He outlined what would likely be California’s argument in a suit: The government’s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized. “Agencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are ‘arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.’ Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.” Negotiations still possible But California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration’s orders. When Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over. California “might do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don’t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.” Advertisement After Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table — but not on the current “unacceptable” terms. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. The fact that UC is a public university system adds to the complexities.” Mitchell, the American Council on Education president and former top administrator of Occidental College, said a quick resolution would benefit both sides. He said a months-long process — as it’s been between Harvard and Trump — would have the potential for “great harm.” “These things, the longer they go on, the worse they get,” he said.

Article: Less than a week after he responded to a disappointing jobs report by firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Trump showed reporters a handful of charts with data he liked much more. This combination limits policymakers’ options: Most tools to fight inflation (such raising interest rates) risk hurting economic growth, while most tools to boost growth (such as increased government spending) risk increasing inflation. At the same time, in addition to the slowing pace of job creation, GDP growth averaged 1.3% for the first half of the year, down sharply from the last couple years. Graham wrote, “some peculiar views about women, both related and unrelated to the economy.” The issue in his record most relevant to Thursday’s presentation is Moore’s relationship with the truth.

Article: There’s a genre of conspiracy theory that goes like this: A politician, faced with a particularly uncomfortable or embarrassing scandal, manufactures another story — a distraction — to divert attention and alleviate pressure on themselves. In 1998, congressional Republicans suggested President Bill Clinton had deployed missiles to Sudan and Afghanistan to change the subject away from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which he had admitted to three days earlier. — known for his anti-vaccine congressional hearings and a backyard watermelon ballistics test aimed at proving a former White House aide’s suicide was actually a murder — said at the time, “I’d hate to think this was a ‘Wag the Dog’ type thing,” referencing the 1997 dark comedy in which a president fabricates a war with Albania to distract from a sex scandal. At gaggles, in interviews and on his social media platform, he has made explicit his desire to shift attention away from Jeffrey Epstein — the disgraced financier found dead from suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. As a reminder, in July, Epstein again took over the national narrative when the Department of Justice, after months spent dangling the promise of new revelations, published a memo stating that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted, there was no client list to pursue and that Epstein had, in fact, killed himself. Mainstream press took up the subject, too, in coverage that revealed new details of the friendship between Epstein and Trump and followed the fight for the release of the so-called Epstein files as was being called for by a strange new consortium of Democrats, MAGA followers and some of Epstein’s victims. In the weeks since, Trump has openly attempted to redirect the national conversation, insisting people focus instead on flooding in Texas, or America’s success, or most recently, the revival of a familiar conspiracy theory: that Obama and the intelligence community framed Russia for interfering in the 2016 election all in an effort to undermine Trump’s presidency. “People should really focus on how well the country is doing, or they should focus on the fact that Barack Hussein Obama led a coup,” Trump said in July, when asked about Epstein. spy agencies to manufacture a narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf — a “hoax” the current president has railed against for years, claiming it was orchestrated to undermine him. Gabbard announced on July 18 that she had found evidence of “a treasonous conspiracy,” that the Obama administration “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Trump.” The Russiagate rollout has been a slow burn. After her initial claim on July 18 came the release of a declassified 5-year-old Republican House Intelligence Committee report on July 23, a whistleblower twist on July 30, the release of a formerly classified annex on July 31, and finally, reports that Attorney General Pam Bondi had launched a grand jury investigation based on Gabbard’s reports, targeting not just Obama, but also his former directors of national intelligence, the CIA and the FBI. Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement the claims were “outrageous,” “bizarre” and “a weak attempt at distraction.” The New York Times reported the newly declassified documents, in fact, disproved Gabbard’s allegations, noting the emails presented as smoking guns by right-wing media were almost certainly fabrications made by Russian spies. The Bulwark’s Cathy Young called the releases “a nothingburger.” And Renée DiResta, an associate research professor at Georgetown and a contributing editor at Lawfare, likened it to an attack “by document — flooding the zone with memos and annexes most people on X will never read, relying instead on influencers and partisan media to shape the narrative for them.” Multiple investigations — including a 2017 Intelligence Community assessment, special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report, a 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee review and special counsel John Durham’s 2023 report — have all concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Trump. None of the inquiries, including Durham’s, which was tasked with looking for it, has ever presented evidence of a plot by Obama administration officials to sabotage Trump or to fabricate intelligence. The same evening Gabbard made her announcement, mentions of Epstein among right-wing influencers on X dropped off, according to data compiled by University of Washington professor and disinformation expert Kate Starbird. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to let the Epstein Files go, because there’s justice that needs to be served there,” said Liz Wheeler, a MAGA podcaster who was among the first and loudest critics of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein affair. “But something bigger broke since then, and it’s been more important to us for a long time.” Wheeler, who was among a handful of influencers invited to the White House in February and photographed holding binders of already-public Epstein documents, said the new Russiagate investigation didn’t distract her — it confirmed that Trump was listening to his base and delivering on their demands for justice, of some kind. Longtime conspiracy theory researcher Travis View, co-host of the “QAnon Anonymous” podcast and a producer at Cursed Media, said that even the most Epstein-obsessed, conspiracy-addled faction of MAGA had been pulled in by Gabbard’s revelations. He can promise a special investigation and keep people in perpetual suspense of the big reveal that never comes.” Trump’s pivot to Russiagate, View said, is a cleaner narrative — especially given his uncomfortable association with Epstein. For those of us who still believe in quaint ideas like karma or shame — the regular folks forced to face the consequences of our own actions — it’s maddening to watch as Trump once again seems poised to slip free from another mess of his own making. While the MAGA outrage has shifted — away from Trump and Epstein, and onto a narrative with familiar bad guys and less of the mess — the mainstream press won’t let go. “It’s put out by the Democrats because we’ve had the most successful six months in the history of our country, and that’s just a way of trying to divert attention to something that’s total bullshit, OK?”

Article: Texas Legislature to take another swing at redistricting vote as Democrats extend their walkout Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. "If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on "Fox News Sunday." When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate - such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California - Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. "They know that they're going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they're trying to steal seats," Pritzker said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful." President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful than it ever was before." "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump wrote Sunday. We're going to put you in jail where you belong." Last week the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option "to extend as needed." On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was "ridiculous" and the city was "unsafe," after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. "I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard," she said Sunday on MSNBC's "The Weekend," acknowledging it is "the president's call about how to deploy the Guard." Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as "one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, "Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false." Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are all down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Trump offered no details in Truth Social posts over the weekend about possible new actions to address crime levels that he argues are dangerous for citizens, tourists and workers alike. The president criticized the district as full of "tents, squalor, filth, and Crime," and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. The president called Bowser "a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances." Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: Brown | AFP | Getty Images On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the "electric vehicle mandate" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax-and-spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives. Despite the automaker touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000. Jacobson said last month that GM has an "inherent advantage" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings. Ford Motor Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's July 30 call with analysts that it has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation "pretty massively" as a result of softer regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

Article: Netanyahu defends new military offensive in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel "has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a "targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign." Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his "steadfast support." Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a "global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to "bring in more foreign journalists" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. "But I have no other choice to feed the kids." Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: "There were no incidents at or near our sites today." Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said artificial general intelligence, or "AGI," is losing its relevance as a term as rapid advances in the space make it harder to define the concept. "I think it's not a super useful term," Altman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. The AI entrepreneur has previously said he thinks AGI could be developed in the "reasonably close-ish future." The problem with AGI, Altman said, is that there are multiple definitions being used by different companies and individuals. One definition is an AI that can do "a significant amount of the work in the world," according to Altman — however, that has its issues because the nature of work is constantly changing. "I think the point of all of this is it doesn't really matter and it's just this continuing exponential of model capability that we'll rely on for more and more things," Altman said.

Article: The president said the subject of news conference will "not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." The event comes a week after the president again threatened a federal takeover of D.C. In recent days, the president boosted the federal law enforcement presence in D.C., which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt framed as a "first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, DC." Trump also has the authority to take control of the local police, but Congress would need to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which granted D.C. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said in an MSNBC interview yesterday that she thinks Trump will announce he is surging federal law enforcement in the capital and pushed back on the assertion that D.C. “If the priority is to show force in an American city, we know [Trump] can do that here, but it won’t be because there’s a spike in crime,” Bowser said. The president said on Truth Social that he would also discuss plans to make the district "more beautiful than it ever was before," which would include removing homeless people from the city. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." In a separate post to Truth Social, Trump indicated he would also focus on "the Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." He then referred to the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, which he has previously criticized, saying it "could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner" for far less money.

Article: As people rushed to help, it became apparent that five Al Jazeera staff had been killed, including Anas al-Sharif, one of the most famous faces of Arabic reporting from Gaza. The tent was where they worked, as journalists in Gaza have gathered at hospitals to seek better electricity and internet connections, a fact that has been well-known since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza. “I’m not far from al-Shifa Hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa Hospital,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported yesterday. “I could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa Hospital.” What happened? Shortly before being killed, al-Sharif wrote on X that Israel had launched intense, concentrated bombardment – also known as “fire belts” – on the eastern and southern parts of Gaza City. “[I thought] all our colleagues were martyred.” Al-Sultan added that he wasn’t sure who the journalists were who were in the tent, but “when I started filming, I saw our colleagues Anas al-Sharif was on the ground and Mohammed Qreiqeh, who was on fire. “We started to pull him out and try to put out the fire.” The people gathered there tried to get Qreiqeh inside al-Shifa Hospital, but he succumbed to his wounds before they could get him treatment, al-Sultan said. Israel’s army posted about deliberately killing the journalists, claiming it had wanted to kill al-Sharif, who it accused of being an armed commander for Hamas only posing as a journalist. Two of the most prominent incidents included journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh, and journalist Hossam Shabat, who were both assassinated by Israel and accused of being members of Hamas without any evidence. Israel has banned international media from entering Gaza since October 2023, but “Al Jazeera journalists remained within besieged Gaza … [delivering] searing eyewitness accounts of the horrors unleashed over 22 months of relentless bombing and destruction,” the statement said. Israel ramped up a smear campaign on al-Sharif in recent months, with army spokesperson Avichay Adraee calling out al-Sharif by name in a video on X last month, accusing him of being part of Hamas’s military wing.

Article: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person overnight as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit between Putin and Trump. KYIV, Ukraine -- A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two more in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, the region's governor said Monday, as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit meeting in which Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to persuade his U.S. A Ukrainian official said at least four drones launched by the country's security services, or SBU, struck a plant in the city of Arzamas that produced components for the Khinzal 32 and Khinzal 101 missiles. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an "absolutely legitimate target" because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Donald Trump will host in Alaska later this week, sees Putin unwavering on his maximalist demands to keep all the Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy but also to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO with the long-term aim to keep the country under Moscow's sphere of influence. Spokesman Steffen Meyer reiterated that the German government "has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate "independently and autonomously." Meanwhile on the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war, other than a brief respite before Moscow resumes its attacks with even greater might.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) FILE - Federal agents escort a family to a transport bus after they were detained following an appearance at immigration court, July 22, 2025, in San Antonio, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House's border security and mass deportation agenda. The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget. The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.” The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said. But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall. “We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated" through the new law. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.” All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.” As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

Article: President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is "the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an “absolutely legitimate target” because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Donald Trump will host in Alaska later this week, sees Putin unwavering on his maximalist demands to keep all the Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy but also to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO with the long-term aim to keep the country under Moscow's sphere of influence. Spokesman Steffen Meyer reiterated that the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Meanwhile on the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war, other than a brief respite before Moscow resumes its attacks with even greater might.

Article: A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended A pause on higher tariffs for China is due to expire Tuesday. (Chinatopix Via AP) TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl. But he said Trump “hasn't made any firm decisions.” Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez, file) Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Iran's Foreign Ministry says talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency will be "technical" and "complicated." Iran says talks with IAEA will be 'technical' and 'complicated' ahead of agency's planned visit TEHRAN -- Talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will be “technical” and "complicated," the Islamic Republic’s Foreign Ministry said Monday ahead of a visit by the nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with the organization last month. Esmail Baghaei, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters there could be a meeting with Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks.” Baghaei also criticized the IAEA's “unique situation” during the June war with Israel. "Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Aragchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. intelligence agencies and the IAEA had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Peruvian President Dina Boluarte met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Monday during a visit aimed at strengthening economic ties as the two countries look to expand into new markets amid geopolitical challenges and rising trade barriers. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May 2024 on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. “The CEPA is a testament to the determination of our governments to promote freer trade and strengthen our economies,” Boluarte said in a joint news conference with Subianto after the meeting, adding that the deal can promoting the exchange of goods and laying the foundations for future agreements. Boluarte said Indonesia has become a key partner for Peru in Southeast Asia, and said her visit to the fourth most populous country in the world and one of the most dynamic emerging economies in Asia was an excellent moment to reaffirm their commitment to full observance of international law, free trade, South-South cooperation, food security and sustainable development. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” said Indonesia's trade minister, Budi Santoso, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry's data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

The city of Milwaukee and its surrounding suburbs were still trying to dry out Sunday night after getting hit with more than a foot of water from a historic rainfall that caused flash flooding, taking many by surprise. "We were up 2, 3 in the morning outside just watching it creep closer and closer and then recede, so we were one of the fortunate ones." Thousands of other Milwaukee County residents were not so lucky The night of the storm, sewers were operating in reverse, pushing out flood waters into people's yards.

Article: In late January, just two days after his second presidential inaugural, Donald Trump told Russia that if it failed to end its war in Ukraine quickly, the White House “would have no other choice” but to impose new economic sanctions. Nearly two weeks ago, on July 29, the American president brought new specificity to his threat, telling reporters that Putin’s regime had just 10 days to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine — the neighboring country it invaded three years ago — or the United States would impose new economic penalties on Russia. Those who predicted that Trump was serious — this time would be different from all of those other times; this time Putin had gone too far and earned the American president’s contempt — were predictably wrong. NBC News reported: Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Complicating matters further, the Republican announced that he was welcoming Putin to American soil — the two are now scheduled to meet in Alaska on Friday — handing Moscow a related diplomatic coup. (Because the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children, the Russian dictator generally hasn’t been able to travel outside of his own country. The American president nevertheless invited him to the U.S.) Just days earlier, the official White House line was that Trump was willing to meet with the Russian leader, but only if Putin agreed to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump not only abandoned his own sanctions deadline (again), not only invited Putin onto American soil in exchange for nothing, and not only gave an international pariah the legitimacy he craves, he also took some time at a White House event on Friday to assure the world that Putin “wants to see peace.” Russia’s war — which has intensified during Trump’s second term — clearly proves otherwise, and Trump himself has repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that Putin most certainly does not want peace. At the same White House event on Friday afternoon, the American president also suggested that Ukraine might have to agree to let Russia keep some of the Ukrainian territory that the Russian military took by force. is “done with the funding of the Ukraine war business.” And around the same time, Matthew Whitaker, the administration’s unfortunate NATO ambassador, suggested on CNN that Russia would likely be rewarded with Ukrainian territory it “earned on the battlefield.” About a month ago, after Trump teased a “major statement” about U.S. Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at Kings College London, told the Times, “It has been a very good week for Putin.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point, though I’d add that with Trump in the White House, it’s been a very good seven months for Putin, too.

The opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, claims the ruling party and the election commission are jointly manipulating elections through obscure additions and deletions to voter rolls. The issue gained momentum after a sudden revision of voter rolls ahead of elections in Bihar, the eastern state of over 130 million that is expected to elect its local government in November. Modi’s party said was to clear the rolls of “infiltrators.” But the opposition sees it as a way of disenfranchising the state’s Muslim voters and other blocs hostile to their Hindu nationalist policies.

The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

At the time, there was no suggestion that the resumption of sales to China would come with conditions or any kind of revenue forfeiture, and the step was celebrated by markets because of the billions of dollars worth of potential sales to China that were back on the table.

Article: Under CEO Matt Baer, a former Walmart and Macy's executive who was tapped to helm the business in June 2023, Stitch Fix posted its first revenue growth in 12 straight quarters for the three months ended May 3. The company, which charges a $20 styling fee for all "fixes" it sends, saw revenue per active client grow to $542 during its most recent quarter, up 3% from the year-ago period. "It's been really affirming to us that, you know, with this return to growth, with this increase in engagement, with this increase in average order value, that we do have the right strategy," Baer told CNBC in an interview. "We've got the right team and we're executing against it at a high level as well." Stitch Fix hasn't posted an annual profit since 2019 but for three straight quarters, its year-over-year losses have narrowed. To be sure, Stitch Fix's sales growth in its fiscal third quarter was modest, up just 0.7%, but it expects those gains to continue in its current quarter with sales projected to be flat to up 1.7% year over year. The rise and fall Retail and restaurant consultant Katrina Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 with the mission to combine data with personalized styling to develop a shopping experience that actually felt individualized at scale. In a world where shoppers regularly groan about the banality of modern-day shopping, Stitch Fix sought to be the panacea by offering accessible personal stylists that could design and ship outfits specific to a customer's unique needs and preferences. Source: Nasdaq But then the market grew crowded and suddenly, customers found themselves overwhelmed by all of the companies looking to sell them a monthly subscription box, whether it was a package of clothes, beauty products or dog treats. In January 2023, StitchFix announced that CEO Elizabeth Spaulding would be stepping down and Lake would return to the helm as its interim CEO and lead the search process for a new top executive. But Baer's career in retail started long before that: At 16, he started working in his family business, Baer's Furniture & Interior Design, a small chain of furniture stores dotted along the Florida coasts and founded by his great-grandfather in 1945. I was able to understand their needs and translate that into an exceptional service that we could provide." Matt Baer, CEO of Stitch Fix Courtesy: Stitch Fix Baer said his first order of business after taking over at Stitch Fix was to understand the company's primary client and how that shopper was experiencing the service. In Stitch Fix's early days, customers had one option – five items in a box at a recurring cadence with one discount mechanism – but these days, there's less rigidity. Customers can order a fix on demand, opt in for regular deliveries or shop through Stitch Fix's "freestyle" catalog, which allows them to instantly select and buy pieces based on their style profile. With no physical retail presence, Stitch Fix's online customer acquisition is expensive and the company has to manage the headaches of packing individual boxes and then processing the stream of free returns that come when clients don't like the items that came with their fix. Courtesy: Stitch Fix Another primary area of focus was adjusting Stitch Fix's assortment and revamping its private brand portfolio, which comes at a higher margin and makes up between 40% and 50% of sales, according to Stich Fix. More than two years into his tenure, Baer said he's still attending monthly client focus groups and styling fixes for customers "nearly every day," which he said allows him to stay close to customers. "One client, she lives in Letcher, South Dakota, population 159, and it's only because of Stitch Fix that she has access to these brands, that she has the ability to wear product and clothes that are differentiated, unique and special within her community," said Baer. "That feels great when I give her that confidence, when I'm able to create that joy for her." More work ahead Stitch Fix's turnaround comes at a difficult time for the apparel industry. Shoppers are more selective than ever with their discretionary dollars, and Stitch Fix's $20 styling fee can feel unnecessary when customers can purchase many of the same items the retailer offers right off the rack and directly from the brand. In a June research note, financial firm Mizuho Securities said Stitch Fix's growth in average order value is expected to dissipate in fiscal 2026 as it laps its expansion into larger fixes. "While management attributed outsized growth to more opportunistic spend and some natural investment cycle, we caution whether it's becoming more expensive to keep the active customer base engaged," Mizuho analyst David Bellinger wrote.

Article: Dame Stephanie 'Steve' Shirley, technology pioneer, dies aged 91 27 minutes ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman • @zsk Technology editor Share Save AFP via Getty Images Visionary tech pioneer and philanthropist Dame Stephanie Shirley has died at the age of 91. The boundary-breaking entrepreneur arrived in London at the age of five, just weeks before the outbreak of World War Two, and went on to become a computer industry and women's rights pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s. She founded the software company Freelance Programmers in 1962, which shook up the tech industry by almost exclusively hiring women, and in later life donated almost £70m to help those with autism and to IT projects. He had hoped that being in a position of power would protect his family, but as the Nazi government increased its persecution of German Jews, they fled to the Austrian capital Vienna. She was one of thousands of Jewish children fleeing the Nazis and came to Britain as part of the Kindertransport - a British rescue effort in the months preceding World War 2 which brought 10,000 children to the UK - where she was brought up by loving foster parents. Dame Stephanie Shirley Dame Stephanie (left) and her sister, pictured with their German father and Austrian mother, who put them on a Kindertransport train to escape Nazi-occupied Austria Determined not to be defined by her traumatic childhood, Dame Stephanie founded a company designed to provide jobs for women with children. After starting out as a scientific civil servant, in 1962 she founded software company Freelance Programmers - later known as FI Group, later still Xansa - something which was almost unheard of for a woman to do in the 1960s. Her late son Giles was autistic and she was an early member of the National Autistic Society, with her charity the Shirley Foundation funding many projects particularly related to autism.

Article: During a recent “expletive-laden address” at the Army War College, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted, “We are laser-focused on our mission of warfighting.” The former Fox News host did not, however, specify which war, exactly, he’s eager to win. The beleaguered Pentagon chief doesn’t even seem especially embarrassed about his culture-war focus, boasting on Fox News last week that he’s focused of late on things like “statues” and “paintings.” How do these efforts advance the nation’s national security goals? Late last week, Hegseth also used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. While it’s important to emphasize that Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, he nevertheless thought it’d be a good idea to promote the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” What’s more, the secretary’s office didn’t make much of an effort to distance himself from the video Hegseth amplified. Four days into Donald Trump’s second term, 50 Senate Republicans overlooked Hegseth’s record and radicalism and confirmed him to serve in one of the most important and powerful positions in the United States government.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city’s mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” Ahead of that news conference, Trump said Monday on social media that the nation’s capital would “LIBERATED today!” He said he would end the “days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move also comes as he has sought to consolidate more of society’s power under the White House in ways that raise fundamental questions about how the federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s military targeted and killed an Al Jazeera correspondent and others with an airstrike late Sunday in Gaza, after press advocates said an Israeli “smear campaign” stepped up when Anas al-Sharif cried on air over starvation in the territory. READ MORE: Netanyahu defends military expansion in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Both Israel and hospital officials in Gaza City confirmed the deaths of al-Sharif and colleagues, which the Committee to Protect Journalists and others described as retribution against those documenting the war in Gaza. The airstrike came less than a year after Israeli army officials first accused al-Sharif and other Al Jazeera journalists of being members of the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike a “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif’s death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. WATCH: Netanyahu lashes out at critics of plan to occupy Gaza City as condemnation mounts Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The U.N. human rights office on Monday condemned Sunday’s airstrike targeting the journalists’ tent “in grave breach of international humanitarian law.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 journalists have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Funeral-goers call to protect journalists Al-Sharif reported a nearby bombardment minutes before his death. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group’s regional director, said in a statement.

Article: Finnish authorities say they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia FILE - The Cook Islands-registered oil tanker Eagle S is anchored near the Kilpilahti port in Porvoo on the Gulf of Finland, Dec. (Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva via AP, File) HELSINKI -- Finnish authorities said Monday they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia. The Finnish deputy prosecutor general said in a statement that charges of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications were filed against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union’s executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Monday's statement alleges that “the Eagle S, which left Russia’s Ust-Luga with a cargo of oil products, is suspected of cutting five submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland by dragging its anchor on the seabed for about 90 kilometers (56 miles)." Prosecutors said the owners of the cables have suffered a total of at least 60 million euros ($69.7 million) in repair costs. It added that the defendants "consider that Finland lacks jurisdiction in the case, as the locations of the cable damages are outside Finnish territorial waters.” The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of Estonia's electricity needs in winter, did not disrupt service, although it drove up energy prices in the Baltic nations.

A federal judge in New York on Monday rejected a request by the Justice Department to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted procurer for notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department sought the unsealing of grand jury material related to Maxwell and Epstein after harsh criticism of the Trump administration's decision not to publicly release the investigative file on Epstein.

CEO Adam Aron said the company's results are indicative of a "recovering industry-wide box office" after previously struggling to pare losses amid dual writers' and actors' strikes and an overall post-pandemic decline in movie attendance. "In so doing, we have put in place a solid foundation to capitalize on what we believe will be our industry's continued growth momentum, especially evident in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continuing deep into 2026." Aron also said the company saw consolidated admissions revenue per patron topping $12 for "the first time ever," with total consolidated revenue per patron reaching an "unprecedented" $22.26. "The combination of a resurgent box office, our unparalleled theatre footprint with premium experiences galore, our compelling marketing programs and our increasing financial strength have a flywheel impact when they all are happening simultaneously," Aron said.

Article: It's natural to feel like being a good investor means coming up with a complicated strategy that maximizes returns, Morgan Housel, author of "The Psychology of Money," said on a recent episode of The Burnouts podcast. But when it comes to investing, "the more complicated you make it, the worse you're probably going to do." Instead of chasing hot stocks or trying to time the market, the smartest approach to investing is making it as "brainless and simple and boring as you can," Housel said. "If you can be an average investor for an above-average period of time, like just earn average market returns every year for the next 20 years, you'll do amazing," Housel said. "The simple people who can be simple and average for 50 years are the ones who end up doing the best." One of the best tools for this approach is a low-cost index fund, which tracks a market index like the S&P 500 and aims to replicate its performance. Considering that even the world's most seasoned money managers struggle to consistently beat their benchmark indexes, investing to merely keep pace with the market is a savvy, low-effort approach, says Ben Smith, a certified financial planner and founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You don't have to pick and choose different stocks and be really strategic, because that often doesn't work out very well, at least for most investors." Data indicates the same: Between January 2015 and December 2024, only 7% of active mutual fund managers beat their average passive rival, according to Morningstar.

The BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. Critics and opposition leaders have also warned that the exercise is similar to that of a 2019 citizenship list in eastern India’s Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness.

Article: Trial to start on whether deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles violated federal law A federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed troops to Los Angeles. SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California "to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer." MORE: Another 1,350 National Guard troops being withdrawn from Los Angeles, Pentagon says The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can't second guess the president's decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act "fail as a matter of law." They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country "is invaded," when "there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government," or when the president is otherwise unable "to execute the laws of the United States." Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles "fall far short of 'rebellion.'" "Next week's trial is not cancelled," he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

Article: Judge denies release of Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury transcripts toggle caption New York State Sex Offender Registry/AP A federal judge in Manhattan on Monday rejected the Trump administration's request to release grand jury transcripts from Justice Department investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. "Its entire premise—that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them—is demonstrably false," Engelmayer wrote. He said the materials provide no new insight into Epstein or Maxwell clients, nor new information about the venue, new sources of their wealth, or the circumstances of Epstein's death. They promised transparency on the Epstein matter, but in July the Justice Department and FBI released a memo that knocked down several of those theories and said no further materials from the Epstein investigations would be made public, touching off public outrage including from Trump's MAGA base . In an effort to contain the fallout, the president, who knew Epstein, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts from the department's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell. Sponsor Message The department followed up by asking three federal judges — two in Manhattan and one in Florida — to unseal the grand jury transcripts from investigations into Epstein and his longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Law What it takes to release documents like the 'Epstein files' What it takes to release documents like the 'Epstein files' Listen · 5:07 5:07 Manhattan-based judge Engelmayer falls under the 2nd Circuit, where precedent allows for the public release of grand jury materials under certain special circumstances.

Article: PARIS (AP) — A heat wave gripped parts of Europe on Monday, sending temperatures up to 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 Fahrenheit) in southern France and increasing risks of wildfires in wine country, while Bulgaria suffered blazes along its southern borders and Hungary saw record-breaking weekend temperatures. READ MORE: Heat advisories, warnings issued for Southeast and Midwest as temperatures soar According to the U.K.-based Carbon Brief, 2025 is predicted to be the second- or third-warmest year on record. EU data show burned area across the continent is already far above the long-term average this summer, with major outbreaks in Spain, Portugal and deadly blazes in Greece since late June. Massive blaze in France In France’s Aude department, a patchwork of vineyards and Mediterranean scrubland, hundreds of firefighters remained in the rolling wine country guarding the edges of a massive, deadly blaze that scorched 16,000 hectares last week. On Monday, the French national weather authority, Météo-France, placed 12 departments on red alert, the country’s highest heat warning, anticipating exceptional heat stretching from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean plains. “Don’t be fooled — this isn’t ‘normal, it’s summer.’ It’s not normal, it’s a nightmare,” agricultural climatologist Serge Zaka, told BFMTV from Montauban in France’s Tarn-et-Garonne department, where the blistering heat pressed relentlessly throughout the day. Nearly 200 fires have been reported; most have been brought under control, localized and extinguished, but the situation remains “very challenging,” said Alexander Dzhartov, head of the national fire safety unit.

Article: AOL is set to shut down its dial-up internet service, ending more than three decades of the iconic symphony of beeps, screeches and static that once signaled your gateway to the World Wide Web. As a result, on September 30, 2025, this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued," the company said. Though the sluggish internet service may seem like a relic of the 1990s and early 2000s, nearly 160,000 people connect to the internet through their landline telephone service, according to 2023 data from the U.S. The acquisition, valued at $350 billion, was considered one of the biggest media mergers in history and came at the height of the "Internet bubble." The merger failed miserably due to cultural clashes between the companies and the decline of AOL's business model, leading to record losses for both companies.

Article: Rapists 'probably' forfeit right to choose gender - Sturgeon 29 minutes ago Share Save Angus Cochrane BBC News Share Save ITV News questioned the former SNP leader on the political and personal revelations in her book. The former first minister, in an interview with ITV to mark the release of her memoir, also said she was partly to blame for the debate on gender recognition laws in Scotland losing "all sense of rationality". Spindrift Isla Bryson jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape It led to a change in policy so that all newly-convicted or remanded transgender prisoners are initially placed in jails according to their birth sex. "I think what I would say now is that anybody who commits the most heinous male crime against women probably forfeits the right to be the gender of their choice." When pressed about that comment, she added it was "probably was not the best phrase to use". "I should have taken a step back and said, 'How do we achieve this?"' SNP MSP Michelle Thomson, who along with Conservative MSP Russell Findlay proposed an amendment to the gender recognition bill that would have halted gender recognition certificates being given to rapists, said Sturgeon's comments came "too late". "Had she stopped to consider or engage with concerns regarding women's existing rights she would not have forced the SNP group to vote against my amendment to temporarily pause the granting of GRCs to rapists. "For that reason I think that Nicola should really apologise for her failure to listen and act on the views of others." PA Media Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond fell out after the 2014 referendum Sturgeon's memoir, Frankly, will be published on Thursday. Findlay, now Scottish Tory leader, said: "Frankly, Nicola Sturgeon must be delusional if she thinks the women of Scotland will swallow this drivel." He added: "Her absurd ideological belief in self-ID collapses with her belated mealy-mouthed admission that this rapist is a man, but she still can't bring herself to say sorry for all the pain and misery she has caused." Sturgeon also reflected on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, when she campaigned for Yes while serving as deputy first minister to Alex Salmond. "I knew I was going to have to sit him down and say, 'look, you're going to have to read this, and you're going to have to tell me now if there are bits you want to change, because it has to be signed off'. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." He died aged 69 in October. He said Salmond "had spent several years guiding SNP policy to form the basis of a credible case for independence on the back of having ran the most competent government in the history of Scotland". McEleny added: "Nicola's upset that Alex went on a trade mission and left her to complete a task she was responsible for sums up her lack of personal political accountability."

That is some of the reaction to news that two of the world's tech giants will pay the US government 15% of their revenue from selling certain advanced chips to China. But developing them was the only option for accessing the significant Chinese market after the previous administration of President Joe Biden banned US companies from exporting the most advanced chips to China because of national security concerns. More importantly, what message does it send to other US companies that see China as a key market or supplier - from Apple and Tesla to the small furniture and toymakers? Getty Images Artificial intelligence is expected to change the global economy The 15% cut that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to is likely to hurt their bottom line, even if they earn substantial profits from sales to China. A US official told Reuters that the White House did not believe the sale of H20 and equivalent chips would compromise national security - despite the fact they were previously banned on these grounds. National security experts and some lawmakers have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.

Article: LONDON — Europe is scrambling to stop itself and Ukraine from being frozen out of peace talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, fearing they could reshape the military and political future of the Continent without them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself recounted upward of 15 phone calls with world leaders and others this weekend, from France and Germany to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as news sunk in that there may be no one at the meeting from the country that has been occupied and bombed for more than three years. “We cannot accept” territorial questions being “discussed or even decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told his country’s state broadcaster ARD on Sunday. “I assume that the American government sees it the same way.” Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, Merz and other European leaders issued a joint statement Sunday saying that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Trump announced last week that he would join Putin in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face discussion of his second term, and the first with the Russian president by any G-7 leader since Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022. It is also demanding that Ukraine cede control of the eastern regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, not just the parts of those territories that Moscow currently occupies and that make up around 20% of Ukraine’s total territory.

Ricky Jones, 57, described far right protesters as "disgusting Nazi fascists" at a demonstration in Walthamstow on 7 August last year, according to a video of the event shown to jurors. Opening the case for the prosecution, Ben Holt said Mr Jones had received a flyer warning of a planned protest outside the immigration centre by activist Tommy Robinson, and his supporters. "During this speech Mr Jones referred to the other side, if you like, as disgusting Nazi fascists, and he said that their throats needed to be slit and as he said that he drew his finger along his throat. "This is, the prosecution say, in a setting where violence could readily have been anticipated." Mr Holt said Mr Jones was "rabble rousing" a crowd which has been described as "tens of thousands" in size. 'Razor blades' Mr Holt told the court at the time of the unity rally violent protests had already taken place in the UK, in response to the murder of three children in Southport. He said: "In August last year Mr Jones was a Labour councillor for Dartford and as a result, received, authored and at the very least co-signed documents about the state of flux the country was in at the time." The court was also told Mr Jones had been sent images of stickers on trains which advertised the far right "National Front".

Bruce responded that Johnson had simply shared “his opinion.” But when pressed further on whether Johnson’s comments reflected the opinion of the United States government, the State Department’s chief spokesperson replied, “Well, I’m not going to speak about opinion of the government.” The response raised a few eyebrows for reasons that should be obvious: talking to reporters about the country’s foreign policy views are a key part of Bruce’s job, whether she realizes this or not. But while Bruce’s briefings have bordered on satire in recent months, doing lasting harm to reputation and credibility, they appear — predictably — to have been well received in the West Wing. The New York Times reported: President Trump said on Saturday that he was nominating Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department, as the next deputy representative of the United States to the United Nations. Bruce had done a ‘fantastic job’ in her State Department role and that she would ‘represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations.’ Bruce parlayed a lengthy career on Fox News into a Trump administration position, which in turn led to a promotion of sorts. She will still need to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate (which seems like a safe bet); and if successful on Capitol Hill, she’ll likely work alongside Michael Waltz, whom Trump tapped to serve as U.S.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an “absolutely legitimate target” because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine.

Yvette Cooper has said that some supporters of Palestine Action "don't know the full nature" of the group, following the mass arrest of more than 500 people at the weekend. The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and happened after followers caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton. "But it's really important that no-one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." Cooper added there had been "clear security assessments and advice" ahead of the ban. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified." Asked whether there was any reconsideration of the decision to proscribe Palestine Action, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was based on strong security advice. "Palestine action was proscribed based on strong security advice – following serious attacks the group has committed involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage," he said, adding: "Whilst many people may not yet know the reality of the organisation – those assessments are very clear." The spokesman said the police had carried out their duties "without fear or favour", which he said was "a foundational principle of policing by consent".

On Monday, Finland’s National Prosecution Authority said in a statement that the ship’s captain, as well as the first and second officers, had been charged with “aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications” in relation to the episode. The statement did not identify the three crew members, saying only that they had denied the accusations — which according to the authority appeared to involve dragging the ship’s anchor on the seabed for miles and severing five cables in the Gulf of Finland.

Article: A United States judge has denied a request by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to unseal transcripts from a grand jury that indicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned former girlfriend and associate of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a decision issued on Monday, Judge Paul A Engelmayer said lawyers for the government failed to convince the court that extraordinary circumstances warranted the release of the grand jury testimony, which is typically delivered privately and sealed. “[The government’s] entire premise – that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the Government’s investigation into them – is demonstrably false,” Engelmayer wrote in his decision. The DOJ in June announced it would not release any additional documents from the investigation into Epstein, causing an uproar among President Donald Trump’s base, which holds a number of conspiracy theories about the well-connected sex trafficker. In 2021, Maxwell was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein – a one-time friend to the powerful and influential in the US – and was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her crimes.

Article: LEWISVILLE, Texas — A family is suing a North Texas child care center, alleging negligence after they say their 2-year-old child slipped on a wet floor from water leaking in the facility and lost a tooth. In a lawsuit filed recently filed against The Learning Experience-Castle Hills in Lewisville, the family alleges the facility "failed to maintain the safety of their facility, resulting in [the child] slipping on water leaking into the facility during a rainstorm" on May 28, 2024. The lawsuit further alleges the staff at the facility was aware of the water leak, but no warning signs were posted, and staff didn't call 911 after the child's fall "despite the obvious severity of her injuries." "An investigation conducted by the state revealed that The Learning Experience was aware of the leaking water into the building–yet no guards were put up and no warning signs were posted. " The lawsuit alleges a staffer at the center told the child's parents in a call that the child was "just bleeding a little" but was given an ice pack and "doing fine." The lawsuit alleges the center was cited during the investigation by the state of Texas childcare licensing division for failing to clean, repair, and maintain the building, grounds, and equipment to protect the health of the children, and for failing to maintain competency and good judgment in the presence of children. "This was not an unavoidable accident but the direct result of The Learning Experience ignoring a known safety hazard and failing to act to protect the children in its care," said attorney Russell Button of The Button Law Firm, who represents the toddler and her parents. "A 2-year-old girl paid the price for that negligence, and we aim to hold The Learning Experience accountable, so this never happens to another child." The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $1,000,000, but the amount will be determined by a jury.

Article: Analysts estimate earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents on revenue of approximately $14.63 billion, reflecting 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth and about 16% year-on-year free cash flow growth to just under $4.1 billion. Bull case: The bullish outlook for Cisco centers on its positioning in high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and software-centric services, which are expected to drive sustained revenue expansion and margin improvement. The company's FY free cash flow estimate of $13.4 billion represents a free cash flow yield of about 4.7%, Bear case: Cisco's traditional networking hardware faces commoditization risks, and while AI orders are promising, the greater than $1 billion in AI orders the company highlighted in May represented between 2%-3% of the company’s total FY-to-date revenues of more than $40 billion. That's not only less than many AI technology companies, but actually well below the rate of earnings growth exhibited by the S & P 500 generally, although these two are closely related, admittedly due to the outsize effects of technology behemoths like Nvidia. One way to play a modestly bullish view in Cisco is by purchasing a longer-dated December 72.5 calls financed in part with the sale of a nearer-dated strangle, such as the September 67.5/80.

Article: Killing lingering cancer cells In the Phase 1 trial, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.) Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors. “Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.” Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. His team is currently running a randomized Phase 2 trial to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence. A growing field Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.” More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences.

Article: Donald Trump has spent the last few days vowing to unveil the details of a new “beautification” initiative regarding Washington, D.C., which the president has said would involve moving homeless people “FAR from the Capital” and reducing crime rates. “Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR.” As for how, exactly, he intends to do this, NBC News reported, “Trump announced this morning that he will federalize the Washington, D.C., police and deploy National Guard troops in an effort to fight crime.” As far as the White House is concerned, this is the first in a series of related steps. We’ll starting very strongly with D.C.” Crime rates in New York City, Baltimore and Oakland have already sharply improved, and while Trump has repeatedly insisted that crime in nation’s capital is “out of control,” in reality, crime in D.C. The president isn’t just deploying National Guard troops in yet another American city, in response to a crisis that doesn’t appear to exist, he’s also claiming emergency powers to federalize a local police department, despite the apparent lack of emergency conditions that might warrant such a move. The president even appears to be creating new criminal statutes on the fly, declaring at his press conference that those who “even think about destroying a statue or monument” in the city will “go to jail for 10 years.” Does he have the legal authority to make such declarations? 6 rioters, many of whom did far more than just spit on police officers during violent clashes at the Capitol, but who nevertheless received presidential pardons from the Republican just hours after his second inaugural.

Article: The Trump Justice Department lost its motion to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Ghislaine Maxwell’s case, with a federal judge on Monday calling the whole premise behind the government’s effort “demonstrably false.” That premise, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York recounted in a scathing opinion, was that the grand jury details would shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes or on the government's investigation into them. Engelmayer, an Obama appointee, noted that the Maxwell grand jury didn’t hear testimony from firsthand witnesses, victims or the like, but rather simply met “for the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.” He said the evidence presented to the Maxwell grand jury “is today, with only very minor exceptions, a matter of public record.” Rather than exposing new information, Engelmayer wrote, unsealing would expose the disingenuousness behind the government’s claim that unsealing would be revelatory. “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency’ but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” the judge wrote. “A member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand jury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to nothing new,” he wrote, adding that the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.” The judge’s ruling is unsurprising, as I previously wrote about the likely limited nature of what unsealing would reveal. It comes amid the administration’s attempt to handle political backlash from President Donald Trump’s supporters over its refusal to release all the information it has related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while being held on sex trafficking charges. After she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month, the government moved Maxwell to a minimum-security facility — an unusual move that has furthered speculation over what sort of additional favorable treatment she might receive. And still pending in New York is the government’s motion to unseal grand jury information in his case there, which the government has been litigating in tandem with the Maxwell unsealing effort. The judge overseeing Epstein’s New York case has not yet ruled, but given the apparently limited nature of the grand jury presentation in that case as well, he could rule in a similar fashion to Engelmayer.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington including deployment of the National Guard, prompting the city’s mayor to voice legal concerns about who would be patrolling the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump said at a Monday news briefing that he was “deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they’re going to be allowed to do their job properly.” The Republican president compared crime in the American capital with that in other major cities, saying Washington performs poorly on safety relative to the capitals of Iraq, Brazil and Colombia, among others. WATCH LIVE: Trump holds news briefing on plans for homelessness and crime in Washington For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials as well as the National Guard, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. Combating crime The president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday. More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. The National Guard Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Crime statistics Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

On December 14, 2023, Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa was targeted by an Israeli air strike while reporting alongside Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, who was injured in the same attack. Abudaqa was left to bleed to death at the Farhana school in Khan Younis, where they were filming, as emergency workers were blocked by the Israeli military from reaching the site. On January 7, 2024, Wael’s eldest son and fellow Al Jazeera journalist, Hamza Dahdouh, was killed in a missile strike on the vehicle he was travelling in in Khan Younis. On July 31, 2024, Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi were killed in an Israeli attack on the Shati refugee camp despite their vehicle bearing clear media markings and both wearing vests identifying themselves as members of the news media. Advertisement ​​According to Brown University’s Costs of War project, more journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began on October 7, 2023, than in the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan – combined. Targeting journalists is a war crime Al Jazeera has condemned the targeted killing of its correspondents as “yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom”, noting that al-Sharif and his colleagues were among the last voices reporting from inside Gaza as international media remained barred by Israel. Amnesty International condemned the killings as a war crime and honoured al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter, noting he received the Human Rights Defender Award in 2024 for his commitment to press freedom.

What makes this statistic even more stark is that Gaza is losing voices on the ground at a time when Israel has banned international media from entering the besieged enclave. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said the killings of journalists and their detentions since October 7, 2023, have created a news void that will cause potential war crimes to go undocumented. Advertisement In June, the RSF, CPJ and news organisations published an open letter stating that many Palestinian journalists who have been relied on by reporters outside Gaza have faced a plethora of threats and many “face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness”.

In a pre-US-Russia summit push aimed at consensus, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz invited Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting on Wednesday. “The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine,” leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain and Finland, and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement ahead of the call.

Article: Late Sunday evening, Israel’s military targeted Al Jazeera Arabic’s Gaza correspondents Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and three others, killing them in a drone strike against their media tent at the gate of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “If this madness doesn’t end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people’s voices silenced, their faces erased – and history will remember you as a silent witness to a genocide that you chose not to stop,” he posted. For most of their lives, Israel has imposed a full land, sea and air blockade over the enclave, effectively turning it into what human rights groups describe as an open-air prison. Advertisement The siege affected every aspect of Palestinian life – livelihoods, travel and family connections and compelled al-Sharif and Qreiqeh to dedicate their lives to telling the world about their people’s struggle under Israel’s brutal occupation. Al-Sharif studied media studies at Al-Aqsa University in Gaza and was known for his reporting on the Israeli military campaign that began on October 7, 2023, documenting its humanitarian and civilian impacts. Yaser al-Banna, a Palestinian journalist in Gaza, said that when Israel ordered the entire population of 2.2 million Palestinians to flee south – an act that likely amounts to a war crime – al-Sharif stayed in the north to document the events and actions of the Israeli military. At the time, al-Banna was in southern Gaza and Qreiqeh was in the north, and they often traded contacts and exchanged information to better cover the humanitarian impact of Israel’s genocidal war. “My impression of Qreiqeh was that he was always patient and calm.” Colleagues and friends In October 2024, Israel published unsubstantiated claims that al-Sharif was among six Palestinian journalists affiliated with a Hamas cell, which Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied. Carrying the torch Speaking from Al Jazeera’s studio in Doha, Qatar, their colleague Tamer Almisshal revealed that both al-Sharif and Qreiqeh were mentally and physically exhausted leading up to their deaths.

Trump also said at his news briefing that his administration has started removing homeless encampments “from all over our parks, our beautiful, beautiful parks.” “We're getting rid of the slums, too,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be taking over responsibility for Washington's metro police department, he said, while also complaining about potholes and graffiti in the city and calling them “embarrassing.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials as well as the National Guard, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. Combating crime The president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday. More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The National Guard Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is "the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Focusing on homelessness Trump in a Sunday social media post had emphasized the removal of Washington’s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: No plans to change passenger rules for new young drivers a 'major oversight', AA says 50 minutes ago Share Save Emily Atkinson BBC News Share Save Getty Images The government's planned overhaul of driving laws in Great Britain has a "major oversight" by not including stronger driving licence rules for new and young motorists, the AA has said. The AA welcomed the government's plans in the main, but said "the missing element is measures to safeguard and to save new driver and passenger lives by limiting peer-age passengers for six months". They also suggest that male drivers between the ages of 17 and 24 are more likely to be killed or seriously injured than any other age group, apart from those aged 86 or older. Road safety charity Brake said this was due to young drivers being more likely to take risks on the road or crash when they have passengers of their own age, something that does not happen as much for older drivers.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell won’t be released, a judge decided Monday. READ MORE: Ghislaine Maxwell doesn’t want Epstein grand jury transcripts released “And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous,” he added. The judge noted the Justice Department had requested public disclosure of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury, minus redactions to protect privacy, even though the government had identified no information of consequence in the grand jury record that’s not already public. The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.” Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents, in an effort to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who died behind bars while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury’s closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell’s 2021 trial, in victims’ civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses. Epstein already had served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges at the time. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump’s Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn’t exist. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.

Article: TEL AVIV — Outrage is growing over Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned new Gaza Strip offensive, with news of the Israeli leader’s broadening military campaign met with anger at home and condemnation abroad. An association of Israel air force reserve and retired pilots have issued a statement calling for an “immediate end to the futile war and urgent action to bring the hostages home.” “The war being waged in Gaza is exacting an unbearable toll from hostages who have languished in captivity for 676 days, is risking our soldiers’ lives in vain, is causing unnecessary harm to innumerable innocent civilians, and is degrading Israel’s standing in the world to an unprecedented low,” it added on Sunday. The statement — which was the first time the group had explicitly called for an end to the conflict — was issued as Palestinians continued dying from both Israeli fire and hunger. “The decision to send the army deeper into Gaza is a danger to my husband, Omri,” Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, told a news conference Sunday as Netanyahu defended a previously unannounced operation in the besieged and bombarded Palestinian enclave. “We want, first of all, to enable safe zones to be established so the civilian population of Gaza City can move out.” Israel’s goal was not to stay in Gaza — just free it of Hamas, Netanyahu added. “Expanding military operations will only endanger the lives of all civilians in Gaza, including the remaining hostages, and result in further unnecessary suffering,” Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia and Britain said in a joint statement. “This is a manmade crisis, and therefore urgent action is needed to halt starvation and to surge aid into Gaza.” Later Sunday, Al Jazeera said five of its staff members — Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa — were killed “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israeli military said that al-Sharif was “the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.” Al-Sharif and the Qatar-owned broadcaster have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist.

Article: UN condemns targeted Israeli attack that killed five Al Jazeera journalists Palestinians attend the funeral of journalists killed in an Israeli strike Media rights groups and countries including Qatar have condemned the attack. The funerals of Sharif, fellow Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa took place on Monday following the targeted missile strike on their tent in Gaza City. The only materials that have been released for publication are screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. CPJ says at least 186 journalists have been killed since the start of Israel's military offensive in Gaza in October 2023 - the deadliest period for journalists since it began recording such data in 1992. "We call for immediate, safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists." Last month, the BBC and three other news agencies - Reuters, AP and AFP - issued a joint statement expressing "desperate concern" for journalists in the Strip, who they say are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: The announcement on Monday came after an urgent review launched last week after media reports said the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to Israel’s military, including the maintenance of fighter jets, as Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and the Palestinian population rages. The fund, an arm of Norway’s central bank and the world’s largest, held stakes in 61 Israeli companies as of June 30 but in recent days divested stakes in 11 of these, it said in a statement. The Norwegian government began its review after Aftenposten, the country’s leading newspaper, revealed that the fund had a stake in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL), which provides parts to Israeli fighter jets that are being deployed in the war on Gaza. Several of Europe’s biggest financial firms have cut back their links to Israeli companies or those with ties to the country, according to an analysis of filings by the Reuters news agency, as pressure mounts from activists and governments to end the war in Gaza. Last month, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, called on countries to cut off all trade and financial ties with Israel, including a full arms embargo, and withdraw international support for what she termed an “economy of genocide”. In a report titled From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide, Albanese detailed “the corporate machinery sustaining Israel’s settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory”. The report singled out companies – including arms manufacturers, technology giants, heavy machinery companies and financial institutions – for their “complicity” in Israel’s repression of Palestinians from sustaining Israeli expansions onto occupied land to enabling the surveillance and killings of Palestinians.

Article: (This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Josh — I'll start with a chart that caught my eye showing two of the seven semiconductor companies on our Best Stocks in the Market list essentially being one big trade. There's very little daylight between how these stocks act day to day, week to week: President Donald Trump made it clear last week that the manufacturing of semiconductors on U.S. KLA Corp , a company formerly known as KLA Tencorp, has been shocking Wall Street with explosive earnings reports lately, including a 60% increase in EPS with a 30% jump in revenue in the latest quarter. Lam Research is a $130 billion company that specializes in areas of the chip manufacturing process like etch tools that precisely remove material layers from a wafer as well as wet and plasma-based cleaning equipment to remove contaminants. Both companies derive less than 10% of their revenue from North America, which means that Trump's new tariffs represent both a challenge and a substantial opportunity as the domestic demand picture shifts into overdrive. Top sector ranking: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sean — We have seven semiconductor companies on our list (inclusive of semi equipment firms too), which ranks fourth out of our industry exposure: That list includes: ADI , ALAB , AMD , AVGO , KLAC , LRCX and NVDA . Tariffs on imported chips and related technologies are viewed as a tool to protect and incentivize the U.S.-based production, ensuring a stable supply, safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI race. Equipment makers such as KLAC and LRCX benefit as domestic fabs expand capacity, while chip designers like AMD and NVDA gain from increased availability of homegrown manufacturing partners and potentially reduced reliance on overseas foundries.

Article: Milwaukee area drying out after weekend rain causes record flooding on multiple rivers No fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning from the storms that began Saturday night and stretched into Sunday. MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial state records of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. Tom Groppi told WISN-TV that the basement of his Milwaukee home never flooded in more than 50 years, but he had 3 feet (about 91 centimeters) of water in it this weekend. "We are not expecting the level that we saw over the weekend, but there could be some areas that get some heavy downpours," said Sarah Marquardt, a National Weather Service meteorologist at the Milwaukee/Sullivan office. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away in quickly moving water on a road flooded by the Root River in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee. The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon's Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee.

"This year's peak unfortunately lines up with a full Moon meaning even in dark sky areas it will be impossible to see the full 100 meteors per hour," said Mr Burridge. "However, [the Sturgeon Moon] is no reason not to go out and enjoy the shower - it is still likely that you will see at least 1 or 2 fireballs per hour, even with a full moon," he added. "After the full Moon is more likely the better time to view, since the Moon will rise later in the night, so I would recommend the peak nights as well as weekend of 16 and 17 August," he added. Most parts of the UK will sit under fairly cloudy skies though the first half of Monday night, although there will be glimpses of clearer skies too, especially for parts of Northern Ireland, north-west England and southern Scotland. After sunset, areas of cloud and scattered showers are likely to develop across parts of Northern Ireland and the far north-west of England for a time, before drifting into central and southern Scotland.

CDs offering free trial internet service were ubiquitous in mailboxes, and the service’s “You’ve got mail” chime and chatrooms were so famous they inspired a 1998 film about online romance starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But children of the ’90s sat through excruciatingly long waits — and a series of electronic whistles, beeps and static as their modems connected — to download photos of rock singer Courtney Love playing her Fender Squier Venus guitar or Bush front man Gavin Rossdale shirtless. In maybe the most mid-’90s story, The Post wrote in May 1994 about AOL users on the Alternative Rock forum sharing bereavements and poems about the death of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, Love’s husband. (Now, with broadband internet service, computers simply remain connected to the ISP and work at 400 times the speed of dial-up.) For many users, a lasting memory of starting an AOL session are the unforgettable, jolting beeps as the modem connected. Dial-up cratered and the junk mail CDs that AOL sent out to entice people with free hours of internet access became little more than Frisbees for children to fling at each other. In 2015, about 2.1 million people were still using AOL’s dial-up, according to CNBC, adding a quote from an unnamed source that it was “in the low thousands” in May 2021.

The style of both videos — their goofy, very-online mix of accusations and insinuations, their readiness to just say stuff — reminded me of nothing so much as Donald Trump himself. Across that decade, the usual strategy for Trump’s critics, Republicans and Democrats alike, has been to adopt a contrasting seriousness: They have tried to present as the high-minded adults in the room, the ones who aren’t constantly slinging insults, posting nasty cartoon memes and stoking fringe theories.

Article: That's because this week's inflation data is the last before Federal Reserve policymakers convene next week for their annual summer consortium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, an event that will likely shape expectations for their September meeting. "We are Tactically Bullish as we see this week's macro data (Retail Sales, CPI, PPI, Jobless Claims) remaining supportive of [the] bull case, with earnings likely to maintain their positive trend," read a note from the trading desk at JPMorgan. "If the inflation increases are more gradual, then the market is likely to remain unbothered unless/until we get to a level that would make a rate hike a credible threat." To be sure, the team added, the key risk is that CPI will come out stronger. Nevertheless, the JPMorgan trading desk expects that a more threatening level in core, year-over-year inflation would mean a rate of 4.0%, rather than the 3.0% some economists are expecting from the next core CPI report. In this case, easier inflation might drive the S & P 500 to a gain of 0.75% to 1.2% Just a 5% chance that core month-over-month CPI drops to less than 0.25%.

Article: Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts. "You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump. If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, "This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy." "This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote. "If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote. The governor added that if the other states "call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same." Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps. That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

Anas is now gone, and I feel I was wrong to hope, wrong to believe in the justice of this world, watching him appeal – with eyes overflowing with tears – to a global conscience that proved to be low and selective. I wished the war had ended before you were martyred so I could go find you in Gaza and tell you that our voices had succeeded, they had reached to the outside world and driven change. For me, that means speaking, writing, and exposing the crimes of this bloody and brutal occupation … until the day you dreamed of, Anas – the day this genocide, the most horrific in modern history, ends.

The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Just last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines — the same technology used to develop Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed “mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy ”has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,” Nixon said, “not a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.” Kennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting. “There’s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that’s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,” CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. “People feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,” said one CDC employees who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions. An employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it’s not lost on them that Kennedy “has demonized our work.” In an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was “deeply unsettling,” especially for those working in Atlanta.

Article: GENEVA (AP) — As nations began a second week of negotiations Monday for a global accord to end plastic pollution, an artist heaped piles of plastic waste onto a large sculpture in front of the United Nations office. WATCH: New study highlights ‘grave, growing’ danger of plastic pollution to world’s health Benjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, designed the nearly 6 meter (18 foot) sculpture called the “Thinker’s Burden” and built it with a team. Standing by the sculpture, Maria Ivanova, an expert in international environmental governance, said it “wakes you up.” Ivanova is the co-director of the Plastics Center at Northeastern University in Boston. “And this is where I think art is absolutely critical to shift the needle on policy.” Delegates and tourists stopped to ask Von Wong about his work and pose for photos in front of it. Michael Bonser, head of the Canadian delegation, called the artwork “extraordinarily profound.” “It gives us a sense, every day, of what we need to be doing inside the room, what we need to walk out with.

Article: The battle over potential mid-decade redistricting in Texas -- where the state's congressional district lines could be redrawn well ahead of the upcoming census -- continued Monday as dozens of Texas House Democrats remained out of state for a second week to block any potential votes on the map. In Austin, the Texas House of Representatives is scheduled to meet and the redistricting bill is technically scheduled for a second reading (which would not be a vote to pass it out of the chamber). The Texas Senate is also scheduled to meet and may vote on its own version of redistricting legislation, although if it votes the bill out of the Senate it cannot be voted on in the House until there is a quorum. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Abbott has also said he will call special legislative session after special session to get the Republican-supported maps passed, even if Democrats run out the 30-day clock on the current session.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Just before HISD opens its doors to a new school year, the athletic department honored some of HISD's best and brightest athletes and coaches at the 2025 Hall of Honor ceremony at Delmar Fieldhouse. "It is a way we can honor former athletes and coaches, and it can also let current and future students know that these individuals walked the same halls as they walk at the same schools," HISD Athletic Director Andre Walker Sr. "I feel blessed and happy to be here." Russel Charles, a Hall inductee who went to Kashmere then UCLA before starting a college coaching career, which included coaching under legendary Bill Walsh at Stanford. "To be in the same class as him, it means a whole hell of a lot." A preview of HISD's athletic Hall of Ceremony at Delmar Fieldhouse Three from Jack Yates were inducted. Running back from the 1985 state championship football team, Johnny Bailey, Donna Roper of the '83 girls state basketball championship team, and George Walker Senior, who went to Yates in the 1970s.

Also going into the Hall, Bellaire softball's Gabby Smith, three-sport athlete David Hoot from Reagan, and former Philadelphia Eagles and Booker T Washington's Leonard Mitchell. "I would hang in the back of the court and put it up the line, and I had a great lob." The final group recognized was the 1968-1970 Wheatly Wildcats, who are thought by many to have been the best collection of talent and coaching ever in the Houston area.

Article: government will take 15% of the revenue that chipmaker Nvidia pulls in from sales in China of its H20 microchip, which is used in the development of artificial intelligence, President Trump said on Monday. At a news conference at the White House, Trump said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked for restrictions on exports to be eased so that Nvidia could sell H20s into the Chinese market. Trump called the H20 "obsolete," and "an old chip that China already has … in a different form, different name." Nvidia designed the H20 to be less powerful than the company's top-of-the-line microchips to comply with export controls. Trump suggested that Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which he called "super duper advanced," might also be in play, but in a diminished form — and that he'd want a 30-to-50% cut of those sales.

Article: California is asking Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. On Monday, Trump said he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city’s police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as the mayor has noted that crime is falling in the nation’s capital. WATCH: Trump says he’s placing Washington police under federal control and deploying National Guard In June, the Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. The Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. After their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. The Trump administration argued the troops were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel in Los Angeles, which has been a key location in the federal government’s aggressive immigration strategy. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him. The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that AMD, the second-place AI chip maker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

"And nothing that the Israeli forces has produced so far in terms of evidence gives us any kind of assurance that he was even an active member of Hamas." The 'only voice' left in Gaza City AFP via Getty Images Anas al-Sharif was one of the few voices left reporting in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera Anas al-Sharif became one of Al Jazeera's most prominent reporters in Gaza during the war. "He worked for the whole length of the war inside Gaza reporting daily on the situation of people and the attacks which are committed in Gaza," Salah Negm, director of news at Al Jazeera English, told the BBC. Married with a four-year-old daughter, Sham, and a one-year-old son, Salah, he was separated from them for long stretches during the war while he continued to report from the north of the territory after refusing to follow Israeli evacuation orders. He reported on the targeting of his colleagues, including prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in 2024 in an air strike in Gaza City. Raed Fakih, input manager at Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel, told the BBC Sharif was "courageous, dedicated, and honest - that's what made him successful as a journalist with hundreds of thousands of social media followers from all over the world". And even in the face of death, he persisted, because this is a story that must be told." Mohammed Qreieh, 33, was a father of two from Gaza City, the Associated Press news agency reported. Israel alleges Sharif led 'terrorist cell', with little evidence The Israeli military accused Sharif of posing as a journalist, saying he had "served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas" and was responsible for launching rocket attacks at Israelis - but it has produced little evidence to support these claims. In a statement, the IDF said it had documents which "unequivocally prove" his "military affiliation" with Hamas, including "personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents". It has publicly released some screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. He described this as a "longstanding pattern" and referred to the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.

A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu’s office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.” Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: An Israeli airstrike that deliberately killed an Al Jazeera reporter, as well as several of his colleagues, has aggravated tensions between Israel and Qatar, which funds the television network and is also a central mediator in talks to end the war in Gaza. The Israeli attack on Sunday, near a hospital in Gaza City, killed five Al Jazeera journalists, the network reported: the correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh; the photographers Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa; and an assistant, Mohammed Noufal. al-Sharif of being a Hamas fighter — an allegation that he and the network had rejected — and pointedly identified Al Jazeera as “Qatari.” The government of Qatar responded with a strong condemnation. “The deliberate targeting of journalists by Israel in the Gaza Strip reveals how these crimes are beyond imagination,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, said on Monday, in criticizing the international community’s inability “to stop this tragedy.”

Article: ET Campbell RobertsonKatie Rogers and President Trump significantly escalated his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital on Monday, saying that he was temporarily taking control of the city’s police department and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime there. At a White House news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington — including “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth” — that stood in sharp contrast to official figures showing violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days. Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of D.C., called them “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,” and said his office “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.” Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize. Familiar targets: In decrying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Article: The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will need to drastically cut rations to refugees in Kenya due to reductions in global aid, including major funding cuts from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Residents of the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps were beginning to feel the impact of food aid cuts on Monday as the WFP implemented a new assistance system there in which certain groups are prioritised over others. The WFP said aid is being cut by 60 percent for the most vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and disabled people, and by 80 percent for refugees with some kind of income. This will have a serious impact on vulnerable refugees, increasing the risk of hunger and malnutrition.” “There has been a lot of tension in the last couple of weeks or so,” Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi said, reporting from Kakuma. “People were very angry about what WFP is calling the priority food distribution, where some people will not get food at all and others are going to get a small fraction of the food.” These tensions boiled over, triggering protests last week, which left one person dead and several others injured, said Soi, adding that WFP officials she spoke with said the aid cuts from organisations like USAID meant they have had to make “very difficult decisions about who gets to eat and who doesn’t”. “We need to look at them separately and differently and see how best we can channel the system so that it provides.” The impact of these cuts is severe amid concerns over malnutrition. “Already the food that is being issued is quite low, 40 percent of the recommended ration, and this is being shared by a bigger chunk of the population,” Chica said, adding that stocks will therefore not last as long as hoped.

Article: US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the "obsolete" H20 chip to China. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it "a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security." Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue." Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia's chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Kennedy Jr., a leading anti-science voice and longtime opponent of vaccines, “shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.” Similarly, MSNBC reported that the violence has left officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency understandably shaken, and “many are now demanding answers” from Kennedy, who “has long vilified the CDC and contributed to a culture of misinformation that they say makes them targets.” (The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment.) Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University, summarized the deadly violence this way in an opinion piece for The New York Times: “The attack left both himself and a law enforcement officer dead, and C.D.C. union has asked federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, since it is putting lives at risk.” It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump, as of this writing, has not commented on the CDC shooting at all, despite the president maintaining an active publishing schedule on his social media platform in recent days. Jerome Adams told CBS’ Margaret Brennan on ‘Face the Nation.’ During his on-air appearance, Adams, who served with Trump during the president’s first term, characterized Kennedy’s response to the deadly shooting as “tepid,” and emphasized how long it took for RFK Jr. “It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings, and that’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams added. Instead, the beleaguered HHS secretary posted condolences “more than 30 minutes after posting photos of himself fishing on social media.” Time will tell whether the deadly shooting causes RFK Jr.

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so. His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a “humanitarian catastrophe.” Australia’s government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. Albanese says conditions must be met for Palestine recognition Albanese told reporters after a Cabinet meeting Monday that Australia’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. READ MORE: France will recognize Palestine as a state, President Macron says “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said. “The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.” Netanyahu rebuked Australia before the announcement Ahead of Albanese’s announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state. The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. “This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all,” Albanese said. A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state. In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government “will carefully weigh up its position” on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September. “This commitment removes any incentive or diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always stood in the way of ending the conflict,” spokesperson for the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said in a statement. He told reporters in Melbourne on Monday that the move would do nothing to end the “ongoing genocide in Gaza which has been live streamed for the entire world for two years.”

Article: BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — An Islamic court in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province on Monday sentenced two men to public caning, 80 times each, after Islamic religious police caught them engaged in what the court deemed were sexual acts: hugging and kissing. The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” READ MORE: South Korean investigators seek arrest of ex-President Yoon’s wife The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

Article: Congressman Abraham Hamadeh made a brief visit to Syria where he discussed with the country’s interim president the return of the body of an American aid worker who was taken hostage and later confirmed dead in the war-torn country, his office said Monday. Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority. The militant group lost most of its territory in Iraq in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019 when it lost the last sliver of land it controlled in east Syria. Mueller, from Prescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, where he had been hired to fix the internet service for the hospital.

Article: Drivers warned about scam car finance payout calls But the judgement left the possibility open for other motorists to claim, including those who had been charged overly large commission fees. The warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) comes after the watchdog announced it would set up a compensation scheme for motorists who were sold car finance deals that were unlawful. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the FCA announced it would start consulting on setting up a compensation scheme for eligible motorists, and it expects most eligible people to get less than £950. "We're aware of scammers calling people and posing as car finance lenders, offering fake compensation and asking for personal details," said Nisha Arora, director of special projects at the FCA. If anyone receives a call like this, hang up immediately and do not share any information." The FCA said it would never ask people for bank account PINs or passwords, and it has urged people to report any scam calls or texts to Ofcom. In a joint statement with the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the FCA pointed out that motorists could sacrifice up to 30% of any claims award in fees to the CMC or law firm. The point of a centralised redress scheme would be to make it easy for consumers to get compensation, without the need for help from a CMC or law firm, the FCA said. The final bill for the redress scheme could be as much as £18bn, with the watchdog estimating millions of people who bought new or used cars potentially dating back as far as 2007 could be eligible to make claims.

Article: They have got one of, if not the best, midfields in the country, they are really strong in wide areas and it looks like they are signing another centre-half in AC Milan's Malick Thiaw. They have seen Trent Alexander-Arnold leave, and tragically lost Diogo Jota, but have spent heavily to strengthen their squad and won't be distracted by having any stars coming to the end of their contract. How Gyokeres fits in is one of the things I am really looking forward to finding out in the new campaign, and it is the same with other strikers at new clubs, like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro at Chelsea. I was disappointed that he chose to go there over Newcastle, but at the same time I saw him live several times last season and he is a player with potential, rather than offering guaranteed goals. With Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United have spent more than £200m on their forward line, but I still don't see them getting in next season's top four.

Article: A group of Democratic lawmakers is pressing Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink for details on the Trump administration’s plan to pull funds from an Air Force nuclear modernization program to retrofit a luxury jet the president was given by the Qatari government. Jamie Raskin (Maryland) and John Garamendi (California) want answers on the plan to pay for this presidential vanity project with up to $934 million from the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program, which is meant to upgrade the military’s nuclear arsenal. But rather than slash the program (like, say, funding for cutting-edge mRNA research and other things the administration has deemed wasteful), the administration plans to pull $400 million from it to retrofit Trump’s palatial new airplane, Meink said last month at a Senate subcommittee hearing. As one might imagine, the aforementioned Democrats are raising issues in a letter addressed to Meink last Wednesday: We write with concerns about how the Air Force is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to President Trump that likely violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Deb Fischer of Nebraska have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the executive branch’s pet projects, the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting president, who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description: Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the Sentinel program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the Qatari luxury jet to serve as Air Force One — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the Trump library’s private plane. They go on: It appears that funds for programs that the Air Force has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for presidential whims, while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers. On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund joined the pressure campaign, urging the Defense Department’s inspector general to open a probe into whether the administration has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically given to the Department of Defense).

Article: And in fact, he segued in his second term from being strictly confrontational with the Soviet Union, as he was in his first term, to actually forging a friendship with Gorbachev and reducing tensions and setting the stage for the end of the Cold War. BOOT: Well, I think, you know, the prime mover in many ways were, of course, the people of Eastern Europe, the people of Eastern Germany who didn't want to live under a communist dictatorship. And I think Gorbachev also deserves a lot of credit because he did not react in the way that the rulers of China did during the Tiananmen Square protests that same year. So this is a very complicated strategic calculus that the president has to deal with, and I'm not sure that President Trump is aware enough of the nuances or the consequences of his actions. INSKEEP: For that very reason, I wonder which of the president's actions we can see as changing the world and which we can see as getting attention, so to speak. And clearly, in the years since, he has become the preeminent figure in the Republican Party and taken the Republican Party in many ways in very different directions from those espoused by President Reagan. INSKEEP: In the current president's constant changes of attitude and position toward other world leaders, toward various wars and other situations, do you see any possibility of something like you described with Reagan where he confronted the Soviet Union and then got to another phase, and things got better? And so remember during his first term where he went from threatening to rain fire and fury on North Korea to talking about how much he loved Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. But right now, it's very hard to figure out what his method is actually gaining us because, you know, all that zigzagging is, I think, very confusing not just to Americans, but also to other world leaders.

Article: The president’s move also spurred Democratic governors, including Newsom, to pledge retaliatory redistricting efforts in their states — setting up the possibility of an extended standoff that could upend the 2026 midterm elections. Lawler calls for redistricting battles to end Newsom urged Trump in a letter Monday to abandon his scheme, telling the president he is “playing with fire” and “risking the destabilization of our democracy.” Newsom said he prefers that independent bodies draw political districts rather than partisan legislatures, as is done in Texas and most GOP-controlled states. But, he wrote, “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” If Texas and “the other states call off their redistricting efforts,” the governor added, “we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.” Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying in Illinois, New York and elsewhere, and they say they have no intentions of returning as long as Republicans are intent on mollifying Trump. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,” Abbott said over the weekend on “Fox News Sunday.” At the least, Texas lawmakers face $500 daily fines for each absence under legislative rules. She compared both the proposed Texas maps, which would disproportionately affect districts represented by Black and Latino Democrats, and Abbott’s and Paxton’s threats to the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. “Their fight is our fight, and just like the Civil Rights heroes of the past, no matter the cost we are prepared to see it through to the end,” Bowers said.

Article: The U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is happening at a site where East meets West — quite literally — in a place familiar to both countries as a Cold War front line of missile defense, radar outposts and intelligence gathering. But the Kremlin has long pushed back against Putin meeting Zelenskyy -– at least until a peace deal is reached by Russia and Ukraine and was ready to be signed. Putin said last week he wasn’t against meeting Zelenskyy “but certain conditions need to be created” for it to happen and were “still a long way off.” That raised fears about excluding Ukraine from negotiations. READ MORE: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in Russia as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit After the USSR’s collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don’t play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.” Sam Greene of King’s College London said on X the symbolism of Alaska as the site of a summit about Ukraine was “horrendous — as though designed to demonstrate that borders can change, land can be bought and sold.” What’s the agenda? Moscow presented ceasefire conditions that are nonstarters for Zelenskyy, such as withdrawing troops from the four regions Russia illegally annexed in 2022, halting mobilization efforts, or freezing Western arms deliveries. For a broader peace, Putin demands Kyiv cede the annexed regions, even though Russia doesn’t fully control them, and Crimea, renounce a bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language along with Ukrainian. Putin has warned Ukraine it will face tougher conditions for peace as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for territory still under Ukrainian control in the four annexed regions annexed by Moscow. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to cement Russia’s territorial gains, keep Ukraine out of NATO and prevent it from hosting any Western troops so Moscow can gradually pull the country back into its orbit. He believes time is on his side as Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances along the front line amid swarms of Moscow’s missiles and drones battering the country. “A sustainable peace also means that aggression cannot be rewarded.” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday he believed Trump was “making sure that Putin is serious, and if he is not, then it will stop there.” “If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue. Since last week, Putin spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as well as the leaders of South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, the Kremlin said.

Article: What to know about DC Home Rule Act as Trump puts DC police under federal control President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Section 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president the ability to use D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department for "federal purposes" that the president "may deem necessary and appropriate." On Monday, Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of D.C.'s police force. On Capitol Hill, many Democrats have said the moves are a power grab by the president and a distraction from other matters, such as Trump's involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein files. Chris Murphy said in a post on X that "Trump's decision to take over the DC police isn't about public safety" and is "another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent." In a post on X, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith wrote, "WHAT THE HECK IS IN THOSE FILES?!" -- a reference to the Epstein files -- accompanied by a video of Trump in the briefing room for his announcement.

Article: “In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.” The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday. The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said. Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel plans to widen its coming offensive beyond Gaza City to the last areas not yet under Israeli control, and where most of Gaza’s 2 million residents have sought shelter as the territory slides toward famine. The mobilization of forces is expected to take weeks, and Israel may be using the threat of a wider offensive to try to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages or surrendering after 22 months of war sparked by its Oct. Any expansion of Israeli operations is likely to bring even more death and destruction to the war-ravaged territory, around 75% of which is already largely destroyed and controlled by Israel. Netanyahu says Israel will go into the central camps Israel announced last week its plans to take over Gaza City, where it has already carried out major raids and heavy bombardment throughout the war. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss aspects of the plans that have not been made public, said the operation will not begin immediately and will take a significant amount of time to scale up. Few places left to flee Netanyahu said Israel will allow civilians to flee to “designated safe zones,” where “they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.” He did not say where they would go. Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly floated the idea of transferring Gaza’s population to a so-called “humanitarian city” that the military would build on the ruins of the southernmost city of Rafah — now a largely uninhabited Israeli military zone — on the border with Egypt. READ MORE: Israel targets and kills Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif in Gaza airstrike as journalist toll grows A possible negotiating tactic Netanyahu has said he will end the war if Hamas gives up power, lays down its arms and releases the remaining 50 hostages — around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group says it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not give up its weapons as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. But the hostages are Hamas’ only remaining bargaining chip, and it is unlikely to give them up if it believes that Israel will then resume the war, attempt to eradicate the group and carry out plans to depopulate Gaza.

Article: Compared to recent weeks, earnings won't be as much of a catalyst for the markets with only a small handful of stocks in the S & P 500 scheduled to report. Nvidia deal : The market doesn't mind that Club name Nvidia and peer AMD will have to give the United States a 15% share of all AI chip sales to China. The arrangement, confirmed by President Donald Trump on Monday, is part of a broader deal announced last month that restored the companies' ability to sell AI chips to Chinese customers. That ability had been revoked in April, when the Trump administration tightened Biden-era export controls that had forced Nvidia and AMD to design throttled-back versions of their top-end AI chips for the Chinese market. The bigger prize is maintaining the ability to sell to China, a market that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated could be worth $50 billion in the next few years. "From Nvidia's standpoint and from AMD's standpoint, I get it, like 85 cents is better than anything, and it's important for them to be able to sell into China because otherwise you're just handing that market over to China and to the local players. We need to be able to compete there, so that's good," Rasgon said on "The Exchange." He added, "I think that should happen on their own merits." To size up the potential impact of this payment, Nvidia was selling about $8 billion worth of chips to China a quarter prior to the previous export restriction. That's a large number for most companies, but not for Nvidia: analysts estimate the company will do about $200 billion in revenue over its ongoing fiscal year 2026 and $255 billion in fiscal year 2027.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multi-year war between Ukraine and Russia. Trump said he’s going to see what Putin “has in mind” to end the war and, if it’s a “fair deal,” he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting. Asked on Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to Alaska, Trump said the Ukrainian leader “wasn’t a part of it” and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as “really a feel-out,” would be to Zelenskyy “out of respect.” He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy "‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say, ‘we can make a deal.’" The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city’s police force. During his remarks, the president noted how even following “a great call” with Putin in the past, “missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you’d have 60 people laying on a road dying,” a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal. “Now, I will say this, ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” the president added. He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the “best deal that could be made for both parties.” But “there’ll be some swapping, there’ll be some changes in land,” Trump said, returning to the idea of so-called “land swaps,” which he said on Friday would be “to the betterment of both.” Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. “Next Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.

Article: Even as the 47th president, he still regularly launches late-night, ALL-CAPS social media rants about other countries “LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.” But it’s his fear and loathing of China “laughing” at the United States that he’s made into a firm pillar of his political movement. They will regularly fulminate about China dominating the world and accuse every American leader other than Trump of surrendering our country’s greatness to the “globalists” and “communists.” And yet, less than seven months into Trump’s second term, China is sitting pretty when it comes to its economic, military and diplomatic clout around the world. A country with a huge market that was acting as a bulwark against Chinese economic domination of Asia seems like the kind of ally a president obsessed with China’s ascendance would want. Following Trump’s gutting of Voice of America, China expanded its media operations in Asia and Africa, where the citizenry can get a healthy dose of subtle pro-China propaganda with no pro-America counterpart. In a report released in July, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote, “In private, our allies tell us that Chinese officials are gleeful, characterizing the United States as unreliable. But in many cases, Beijing is doubling down on its own long-term investments — in overseas infrastructure, critical minerals exploitation and exchange programs that bring foreign talent to Chinese universities — all while America withdraws.” It also appears that many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot who is advancing China’s interests at the expense of America’s. Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton wrote in The Hill that some examples of “Trump’s softness” on China “include allowing Nvidia to resume exports of sensitive information technology to China and ignoring legal requirements to ban TikTok or force it to divest its Chinese ownership.” Many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot. Trump has also taken pains to not displease Chinese leader Xi Jinping over Taiwan — which the CCP views as an illegitimate breakaway state that it intends to bring under its yoke someday. The Trump administration last month told Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te to avoid a stopover in New York, according to reporting in The New York Times, which also quoted former Trump administration deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger as saying the U.S. “bent over backwards” to avoid offending China and that “Beijing will pocket this concession and ask for more.” Nicholas Grossman wrote in these pages in April, “If the eventual result is China’s rising to become the world’s predominant power, historians will note that it didn’t take global leadership, America threw it away.” But we don’t have to wait for historians’ take on Trump inexplicably ceding many of America’s long-held advantages on the global stage to China.

Article: Five more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing blockade of Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, the Health Ministry has said, as people in the enclave and many beyond its besieged borders mourned several journalists assassinated by Israel. The ministry on Monday said most of these victims died in the past three weeks, as Israel-imposed starvation engulfs the entire population, with the total number of severe hunger deaths now at 222, including 101 children. It’s time for statements to turn into action and for an immediate ceasefire.” At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raids across Gaza since dawn on Monday, including six aid seekers, medical sources have told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, on a daily basis, Israeli forces and US contractors are continuing to kill Palestinians desperately seeking aid at distribution points run by the controversial United States and Israeli-backed GHF. An outpouring of grief and condemnation followed the Israeli assassination of five Al Jazeera Arabic staff in Gaza, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, in a drone attack late on Sunday that hit a tent for journalists positioned outside the main gate of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital. The attack came days after the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, warned of “unfounded accusations by the Israeli army” against al-Sharif after Israel repeatedly and falsely accused the 28-year-old reporter of being a Hamas affiliate. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors: first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming seizure of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Advertisement Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum, who reports for the network’s English channel, said the journalists were “working around the clock to unearth facts on the ground and keep the world informed about what has been going on in Gaza”. Speaking of his colleagues al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, Abu Azzoum said their deliberate killings were being seen in Gaza “as an attempt to silence two of the most courageous voices”.

Article: An explosion at a steel plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States has left one dead and dozens injured or trapped, with emergency workers on site trying to rescue victims, officials said. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it’s like something bad happened.” Dozens were injured and the county was sending 15 ambulances, in addition to the ambulances supplied by local emergency response agencies, Reigner said. Air quality concerns and health warnings The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major US Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers. The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosion and advised residents within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. In another lawsuit, residents said that following a massive 2018 fire, the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs, and was hard to breathe due to the release of sulfur dioxide. Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5m in equipment upgrades and $5m on local clean air efforts and programmes as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by the Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has previously sued US Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” In June, US Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalised a “historic partnership”, a deal that gives the US government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15bn buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after US Steel shareholders approved it.

This is why he formally declared a public safety emergency in the city in a pair of executive orders that placed the Metropolitan Police Department under the federal government control and directed 800 National Guard members into the streets. Trump went even further, seemingly soft-launching the case for potential federal intervention in more Democrat-led cities — Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland — “if they don’t learn their lesson” to address crime. In June, he sent nearly 5,000 troops to Los Angeles — mostly National Guard but also, much more unusually, several hundred Marines — after protests broke out over his immigration policies, blurring the line between the U.S.

Article: Doubt over the accuracy and integrity of the data is a serious issue considering how much BLS work is used to formulate policy, calculate Social Security payments and inform any number of other political and economic decisions. "I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time," DoubleLine CEO Jeffery Gundlach said last week on CNBC. data has never been perfect, but has been of high quality, compiled impartially, and useful in the setting of policy." Questions on multiple fronts Gapen's sentiments mirror those around Wall Street, where written commentary has broken down the various issues the BLS has already faced in terms of budget cuts that have pushed it to alter the way it is collecting some data. Also, notable revisions the BLS has applied to its critical monthly payrolls count have raised concerns, including accusations from Trump that the McEntarfer-led BLS was manipulating the data for political purposes. "We argue the data remain reliable, though we would recommend being careful with the initial jobs data." Looking for inflation clues On the market's plate this week, though, are the two key inflation readings, first with the consumer price index on Tuesday, then the producer price measure, considered a gauge of costs at the wholesale level, on Thursday. At issue for the BLS is its move to stop collecting CPI data from several cities due to staffing limitations, as well as the growing use of imputed data, or estimating price movements in areas where it can't get exact information. In those cases, the BLS will try to use data from another source, preferably somewhere near to the locale it is surveying, but sometimes it has to use prices from other urban areas as assumptions. Bank of America estimates that a combination of different-cell imputation and the varied impact of tariffs likely will alter the headline CPI reading by only a basis point or two — 0.01 or 0.02 percentage point. "Still we do not think the BLS' decision to reduce the CPI sample is enough to warrant alarm over the signal from the inflation data." Impact on Fed moves Indeed, precision will matter as the Federal Reserve closely monitors inflation data and charts its monetary policy course. Excluding food and energy, the respective forecasts for core inflation are 0.3% for the month and 3.1% for the year, the latter up 0.2 percentage point from a month ago. "Sequential firming in inflation is one key factor behind our view that the Fed will remain on hold at the September meeting despite recent employment data that point to a sharp slowdown in labor demand," Morgan Stanley's Gapen wrote. Traders widely expect the central bank to cut the fed funds in September, then at least once more before the end of the year, but Wall Street economists are in multiple camps. "Taken at face value, the new procedures implemented by the BLS should not introduce systematic bias into its estimates of CPI inflation, but it will increase volatility in future CPI prints," Gapen wrote.

Article: Liana Davis alleges Christopher Cooprider secretly dissolved at least 10 abortion pills into a cup of hot chocolate that he prepared for her April 5 and then left the house and stopped responding as she profusely bled, the suit says. Cooprider said he “would like to get rid of it,” the texts show, saying the two were “not in love” or together and that it would be “messed up to bring a child into the world without both parents raising them.” When Cooprider reiterated his desire for Davis to “get rid of it” after her pregnancy test came back positive days later, she asked him to use a different phrase. “I literally feel like I’m going down the steepest hill on a roller coaster when I read that.” The following text messages allegedly show Cooprider telling Davis, without her approval, that he would order abortion pills online.

Article: The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.” Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Article: Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown 44 minutes ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Share Save Watch: Trump announces deployment of National Guard to Washington DC President Donald Trump said he was deploying the National Guard to Washington DC and taking control of the city's police force as he pledged to crack down on crime and homelessness in the city. "I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse," Trump said during a news conference in which he was flanked by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will lead the city's police force while it is under federal control. Mayor Bowser, a Democrat, acknowledged there had been a "terrible" spike in crime in 2023, which mirrored a national trend, but she pushed back against any claims of a crimewave in the city. "The president is very aware of our efforts." When asked about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's comment that Washington is more violent than Baghdad, Bowser said "any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false". That act was instituted by former President Richard Nixon to allow residents of Washington DC - which is the only US city that is not in any of the 50 states - to elect a city council and a mayor. On Sunday, when asked about the possibility of the president taking control of the city's police department, Mayor Bowser said: "There are very specific things in our law that would allow [that]. "We have seen a huge decrease in crime because of those efforts." Watch: DC Mayor Bowser says crime in the city is at a 30-year low As well as crime, Trump also spoke at length about homelessness in Washington DC. "If our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty and they don't respect us." Local groups working with homeless people in the capital told the BBC they had actually seen progress in recent years. Homelessness is down almost 20% for individuals in Washington DC in 2025 compared to five years ago, said Ralph Boyd, the president and chief executive of So Others Might Eat (SOME) - a group that provides people in the city with housing, clothing and other social services.

Article: As this shift to cloud computing took hold, Melius noted that these companies all saw a steep contraction in their price-to-earnings multiples, a classic sign that investors believe slower growth is ahead. The cloud was a priority for CEO Satya Nadella upon taking over in early 2014, and it's paid off handsomely for investors — just take a look at the stock chart versus the S & P 500. Microsoft would have no doubt been on that list of on-premise fallen angels — even if not a hardware play like Hewlett-Packard and Dell — had they not jumped on cloud computing and instead kept their fate tied to the on-premise hardware providers. Instead of companies paying for a perpetual license to use a specific version of software, SaaS companies sold their product on a subscription basis, bringing in a more predictable recurring revenue stream that investors were willing to assign a higher multiple. They added, "We think there will be FOMO across all industries to cut costs and get their stocks up - SaaS is the casualty as AI adoption accelerates." To be sure, while this is a potential concern for Salesforce, plenty of other tech names in the portfolio stand to benefit. Indeed, the Melius analysts themselves contend: "While SaaS should be avoided, 'Software' companies with clouds [such as Microsoft and Oracle] are continuing to see acceleration in demand." "Another area fueling demand is the acceleration of AI agents that do the work of SaaS and fuel demand for more compute," Melius added. Agentic AI is a type of AI system that can complete certain tasks without human intervention, and it's become a big area of investment and focus in the AI race — including for Salesforce. And given that SaaS is generally based on the seat-based licensing model, if Salesforce's customers have fewer employees because their remaining ones are using AI to be more productive, that translates to less demand for software seats — all else being equal. Instead, the company is working to build out its agentic AI offering, appropriately dubbed Agentforce, so that it can help clients move more quickly into the AI era, while also building out a new AI-oriented revenue stream that can hopefully help extract more revenue from those seats at customers that do remain. Unlike Adobe, it's also important to keep in mind that Salesforce is targeted almost exclusively toward enterprise, where the customer cohort tends to be more sticky and a bit slower to change things up, lest they risk a misstep that hurts sales. While Salesforce isn't alone in offering tools to build Agents — Microsoft, which competes with Salesforce in the CRM arena, also has them — the company clearly has a strategy. As a result, we're downgrading shares of Salesforce to a hold-equivalent 2 rating as we look to better understand to what extent Salesforce is being disrupted, or if can indeed adapt to the new world.

When he was arrested at a New York City Airbnb apartment in June 2024, he had over $37,000 in cash and nearly 1,500 stolen account access numbers in his possession, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. He worked with multiple people internationally in the scheme, with one accomplice receiving more than 36,000 stolen EBT card numbers from Graur over the course of three years, the statement said.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israel’s military targeted an Al Jazeera correspondent with an airstrike Sunday, killing him, another network journalist and at least six other people, all of whom were sheltering outside Gaza City's largest hospital complex. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif's death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that it was appalled by the strike. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group's regional director, said in a statement.

Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, “The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin” but it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow. To that point, Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to “tell them what kind of a deal — I’m not going to make a deal. It’s not up to me to make a deal.” Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Trump’s up and down relations with Putin More recently, Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn’t appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn’t done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday’s meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow’s sphere of influence. Europeans will prepare with a virtual meeting on Ukraine this week With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday. The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and “related issues of territorial claims and security.” Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles (418 kilometers) east of Moscow. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Article: Barcelona’s domination of Real Madrid last season resulted in Los Blancos bringing an end to Carlo Ancelotti’s second tenure – even though he had delivered a league and European double a year previous. Rumours rumbled for most of the season, after a low-key start at home and abroad, that former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso would be making the switch from Bayer Leverkusen to replace Ancelotti. With their La Liga and UEFA Champions League defence over, the Madrid-based club wasted little time in announcing Alonso, conveniently at a time when Brazil cranked up their interest in Ancelotti. The first match of the new Spanish campaign is on Friday, August 15 and sees Girona, who finished only a point above the relegation zone last season, entertain a Rayo Vallecano side that claimed ninth spot in La Liga last year. It has been a quiet transfer window for Barcelona, whose finances had been heavily in the spotlight last year with La Liga rules limiting spending on wages and transfers – complicating the registration of Dani Olmo. The Spanish international arrived from RB Leipzig in Germany for a fee of $62.5m in the summer of 2024, but was nearly forced into a free transfer away from the Catalan club due to their dire financial situation. The loan of Marcus Rashford, who made his debut in the 5-0 pre-season demolition of Como, from Manchester United is Barca’s only major addition in the off season to their ranks so far. A 4-0 demolition of Real in Madrid on October 26 kicked off the derbies last season, the first major warning signs that Los Blancos may have a turbulent ride ahead. That defeat for Ancelotti’s side was compounded by a 5-2 hammering in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, before a 3-2 Copa Del Rey final win for Barca in late April left Real facing up to the prospect of a trophyless season. The lack of any major additions to Barcelona’s title-winning squad will throw doubt on whether manager Hansi Flick will be able to push the players to go again without further competition for places. Flick’s side will be fully expected to put up a stern defence of their La Liga title and to go all the way in the Champions League, a competition they were heavily favourites to win last season until their shock semifinal elimination by Inter Milan. Real Madrid will have to cope with the loss of Luka Modric in midfield, only a year after the retirement of Toni Kroos – an absence believed to have heavily contributed to Real’s demise last season. Nonetheless, the link-up between an attack and midfield, which is now missing both of its mainstays for more than a decade, will be the major problem for Alonso to solve. Alongside fellow countryman Julian Alvarez, France and Atletico legend Antoine Griezmann, and Giuliano Simeone, the son of the manager, Almada could well sprinkle the magic needed to elevate Atletico to the top of the pile.

Article: Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County? The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 — on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas. (Aung Shine Oo / Associated Press) Advertisement “It came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,” said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech. Geological Survey) Advertisement The magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine’s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. “It’s not going to come soon, because it’s quite a heavy calculation.” Still, such simulations would provide a model of “all possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.” Rescuers work at the site of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, that collapsed after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake centered in Myanmar on March 28. Or it could be a much larger earthquake — rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. By comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake’s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley — related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7. But while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike. “It is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.” A Buddhist monk walks near a collapsed pagoda on March 30 after an earthquake in central Myanmar. stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.” “And then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,” Avouac said. The entire length of the Sagaing fault — including areas that didn’t rupture in the March earthquake — is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate. These maps show the 317 miles of the Sagaing fault that ruptured in March, compared to the historical ruptures, as outlined in a 2016 study, of the San Andreas fault in California in 1730, 1812, 1857 and 1906. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956. “There’s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.” Advertisement There is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a “Big One” simply won’t ever strike California again. “If there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won’t hold forever.” Further research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said. The other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.

Article: (AP) — The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. “Some water did come in, it’s stinky water, we think it’s sewage, but we’ll be OK.” The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon’s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he’s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters in an inflatable boat on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away as the Root River flooded a road in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee.

Article: As punishment for flouting her order and being found in civil contempt, the judge required Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to file bimonthly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions have been made under the law. In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report. In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law. “ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

Article: The Israeli military last year accused six Al Jazeera journalists — including Anas al-Sharif whom Israel said it had targeted in its attack on Gaza City on Sunday — of being fighters with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. Al Jazeera denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence.” The Israeli military in 2024 killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza, claiming he was a member of Hamas’s military wing, along with a cameraman, Rami al-Rifee, who was not accused of involvement with the militant group. Al Jazeera called the accusation “baseless.” Israel has banned all foreign journalists from independently entering Gaza to cover the war since the conflict was ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. As a result, Al Jazeera’s Palestinian correspondents in Gaza have provided much of the on-the-ground coverage of the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and led to mass privation and hunger in the enclave.

While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, reaching prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling global trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower tariffs at a meeting between negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland. The relationship is very good with [China’s] President Xi [Jinping] and myself.” “We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian in a statement. Even as both countries appeared to be seeking to push back the reinstatement of duties, US trade envoy Jamieson Greer said last month that Trump will have the “final call” on any such extension. Ongoing negotiations Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump’s first term and now with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said she expected Trump to extend the 90-day “tariff detente” for another 90 days later on Monday. “The whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations, and there’s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,” she said.

Article: Trump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”. ‘Represent ourselves’ The rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia. Advertisement The city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.” In March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.” For many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community. Amari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. For his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”. Among those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.” “There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said. While DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data. Groups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”. Twenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”. Tanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred. ‘Best place for us to resist’ Maurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime. “When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.” “It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”

Article: At the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky this morning, Ford executives announced that they plan to retool the factory so they can roll out a midsize pickup truck in the $30,000 range within 18 months. This has long been the goal for a number of automakers: a truly affordable EV — one that competes with gas cars when it comes to the upfront sticker price, without factoring in government subsidies or the savings from gasoline. And they fizzled out." But after canceling its large electric SUV and just recently delaying a next-generation of electric full-size trucks and vans, Ford held this splashy event in Louisville to make it clear it was moving forward — really — with this project. Political headwinds, global realities Technically, what Ford announced is not just a single vehicle but a vehicle platform, which will eventually be adapted into a variety of vehicles that are all built the same way. The Kentucky plant, which currently makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will close for renovations and retooling, and reopen with 2,200 jobs, 600 fewer people than it employs now. Demand for battery-powered cars has come in lower than carmakers' expectations, and with federal tax credits expiring at the end of September , that trend is expected to slow even more. In a nod to those past challenges, Ford executives repeatedly said the new vehicle had to be "sustainable" — a reference not to the environmental benefits of EVs, but to the need for the car to be sustainable as a business proposition. And, at risk of understatement, companies don't always make their initial price targets; the F-150 Lightning and the Cybertruck were both first promised to start at $40,000, a price they never actually hit. Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research at the automotive insights firm Telemetry, said that while there's no guarantee that Ford can pull this off, the new price target is "plausible." "Most of what we know so far about what Ford is doing is not actually entirely new" for the EV industry, he said. Ford plans on reducing costs and complexity by using a small number of very large die-cast metal pieces for a truck's body, instead of a large number of small pieces; that's an innovation Tesla pioneered. And while he made promises about high-tech features and the future, executives also told workers in the plant they could look forward to a more mundane benefit from the $2 billion investment: When the plant reopens next year, Ford VP Bryce Currie told the assembled workers, it would have tempered air — and a much cooler temperature.

President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. crackdown Analysis by Jonathan Allen Donald Trump isn’t the first president to deploy troops and federal agents in the name of safeguarding the nation’s capital, but he has been particularly selective about what represents a threat to the peace. In the summer of 2020, Trump amassed a heavily armed force in Lafayette Square, steps from the White House, and unleashed it on peaceful protesters demonstrating against unprovoked police violence. In appointing himself Washington’s top cop, he promised to clean up a city that he described as having been “overtaken” by “bloodthirsty criminals.” Attorney General Pam Bondi went a step further, vowing that “crime in D.C. That should make it easier for Trump to keep this promise — he can just take credit for what was already in motion — than the ones that have fallen short: ending inflation and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, among others. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was overrun by drug lords — the mayor at the time was arrested after he was caught smoking crack cocaine — and it was known as the murder capital of the world. In the meantime, he has portrayed himself again as a proponent of “law and order” — so long as it serves his political ends — which could allow him to position himself to take credit for a relatively safe and prosperous city, and leave Democrats to fight over how much crime-fighting is too much. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images To better understand how two candidates as ideologically opposed as President Donald Trump and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani could rise to prominence, just ask Ray. (Ray declined to share his last name out of concern that he could face backlash for his political views.) I first spoke with Ray in January when we reached out to some of the swing voters who propelled Trump to victory last year. “But he makes the effort to go out and talk to people and reach out to people and try to actually do things that are better for the working class.” The son of Asian immigrants, Ray has not always been tuned into politics. He registered as a Democrat to have a say in the deep blue city’s politics and because the party supported policies he benefitted from as a kid, like public education, school lunches and afterschool programs. “When I was voting for Biden, it was the expectation that things will go back to normal,” Ray said, later adding, “The problem is we never really got the normalcy.” So he cast his ballot for Trump in 2024, the first time he had ever supported a Republican. “It’s not about Republicans or Democrats in my mind,” Ray said, adding that he is drawn to a candidate “who is honest, who’s authentic, and someone who has the benefits of the little person in the back of their mind.” “I think having that’s important, and I think that’s what’s missing in the politics these days,” he said. 🗞️ Today's other top stories 🌏 Russia-Ukraine latest: Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the war.

Article: DALLAS — North Texas' ongoing population boom means more hospitals and medical facilities are needed to meet the region's healthcare needs -- particularly as rural hospitals around the state and beyond struggle financially. John Henderson of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals recently warned that a third of the 157 rural hospitals in Texas have less than 10 days' cash on hand. "In some of the rural areas, the hospitals are struggling from a financial point of view, a cash-flow point of view and, as a result, they may have to cut back services, which creates a gap, or they may even have to close units," DFW Hospital Council CEO Steve Love said. "Some of the rural hospitals in Texas, unfortunately, have closed labor and delivery because of not having enough physicians, and not having the staff." To help fill gaps in healthcare access and accommodate steep growth in the population centers of North Texas, a number of new medical facilities have either recently opened or are in the works across the northern sectors of the Metroplex. Aside from building new hospitals, Love said he expects North Texas will also see more outpatient clinics and "probably as much focus as possible on telemedicine," as the population continues to grow. So here’s a look at the different facilities major health systems have recently opened or are coming soon to North Texas -- and how the entities behind these new facilities are deciding where to put them. Map of hospitals and facilities recently opened or in the works in North Texas Baylor Scott & White Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest nonprofit health system in Texas, officially opened Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Frisco at PGA Parkway, a new 340,000-square-foot, 84-bed hospital, earlier this summer. "Baylor Scott & White is committed to expanding access to high-quality care built on a legacy of clinical excellence," said Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Frisco at PGA Parkway President Ryan Gebhart when asked when the facility brings to the table. "As North Texas continues to grow, this new medical center is poised to meet the needs of a thriving region." Baylor Scott & White – Frisco at PGA Parkway Chief Medical Officer Eric Beshires said the new facility was designed to continue to meet the needs of North Texas into the future. "As we enter our third decade of Baylor Scott & White's service within the City of Frisco, we are committed to continuing to grow with the community to meet the changing needs of this area." Medical City Medical City Healthcare has expansion projects in the works across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a particular focus on fast-growing Collin County and Fort Worth, the 11th largest city in the country. "As the North Texas region continues to grow and evolve, Medical City Healthcare is strategically expanding to ensure families have access to the essential services they need, including emergency care, mental healthcare, hospital services, and specialized programs," Medical City spokesperson Janet St. "Expansion is focused on underserved communities or areas experiencing rapid population growth, where we can make the greatest impact on community health and provide timely, expert and compassionate care close to home." In the last five years, Medical City says the health system has invested more than $1.7 billion in everything from building acquisitions and expansion to facility enhancements and technology. Medical City Mental Health & Wellness Center Alliance – a 65,000-square-foot, single-story hospital providing inpatient and outpatient services at 3100 Alliance Town Center in Fort Worth – opened in February to provide access to inpatient mental healthcare in the area. That same year, Medical City bought Medical City Mental Health and Wellness Center Frisco at 5680 Frisco Square Boulevard, and Medical City Sachse, a campus of Medical City Plano at 4750 President George Bush Highway that provides 24/7 emergency care. In 2023 Medical City acquired Medical City Decatur, a campus of Medical Center Denton at 609 Medical Center Drive, which is a full-service, acute care hospital with 150 beds, with the goal of "maintaining vital hospital access in a more rural community." This year, work is underway on a new, three-story patient tower at Medical City Arlington that will add 60 more patient care beds, bringing the total thee to 496. The space will house a 28-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit, specially-equipped ICU beds for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (an advanced life support therapy for patients whose heart or lungs are not functioning properly) and shell space for additional beds in the future. Finally, Medical City McKinney is planning a three-story expansion of its own that will add 28 more patient beds for a total of 357, plus four operating rooms, a new post-anesthesia care unit and additional space for day surgery. And Medical City Plano is expanding with 60 more patient beds, bringing the total there to 663, as well as three rooftop helipads, a three-story parking garage and shell space for future patient beds. Located about 40 miles north of downtown Dallas, Celina was the fastest-growing American city among cities and towns with a population of at least 20,000 between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the U.S Census Bureau. We run to it." Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs said the facility is the third-largest employer in the city, aside from the school district and the city itself, with about 250 full time employees. "Just having that facility in its close proximity really lends itself to quality patient care to our residents and the residents of the surrounding area." Before it opened, EMS had to transport patients to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in McKinney, about 14 miles from Celina, which is also expanding. "You may think that a lot of these hospitals are competitors with each other, but I think what I see from behind the scenes is you have very much relationships where they want to work together, where it's really about the patient." Texas Health Resources To help meet the increasing need for services in the area, Texas Health Resources is building the first full-service hospital in Forney. “There is a need with the fast growth in population in the Forney area to really expand care,” said Toya White, who serves as president at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Kaufman and will serve as president of the future Texas Health Hospital Forney. Expanding access to care is something that we’re always evaluating, and really how to meet our population demands.” A spokesperson for the city of Forney said the facility will provide essential services as well as jobs to the community. Along with strong commercial growth, the addition of a world-class, full-service healthcare facility like Texas Health Resources is a tremendous step for Forney," Forney spokesperson Zach Smith said in a statement. "This hospital will not only provide essential services to our residents but will also create high-quality jobs." Texas Health Resources Senior Executive Vice President Laura Irvine said the health system considers population and other demographics when considering where and what types of healthcare facilities are needed in an area. What are the healthcare services that they need, healthcare utilization and what are those current access points.” Beyond demographics, Irvine said Texas Health considers advances in technology to determine what services are needed. We want to make sure we’re matching not just the population and volume of the growth but the type of healthcare needs that they will have.” Irvine said Texas Health has seen the use of e-visits, or virtual visits, increase about threefold in the last year. Explained Irvine: “We’ll want to work with them, make sure they know the services that we’ll be providing from Day 1, and how we’ll work with their EMS and ambulance services that will hopefully provide for them a much faster access for their ambulances than where they are currently driving to." Irvine said the health system also partners with cities and school districts where they plan to build facilities. One example Irvine shared: Texas Health Resources, Forney ISD and the Forney Education Department are partnering on community events and health and wellness initiatives like a Forney ISD back-to-school rally. As health systems plan for new hospitals, Irvine said they work to ensure they have enough land to expand to in the future and that they have planned out where new patient towers or other expansions could go. Late last year, Texas Health Resources also bought 21 acres of land in fast-growing Collin County at the northwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and the Collin County Outer Loop in Celina with plans of expanding there in the future as well. UT Southwestern UT Southwestern broke ground in May on a $177 million radiation oncology campus in Fort Worth to meet a growing need for cancer treatment, officials with the health system said. The 65,000-square-foot facility in Fort Worth's Medical District will include the city’s first MRI-guided precision radiation treatment, four linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation treatment (plus space for two more) and a fully-equipped brachytherapy suite to provide high-dose radiation treatments for patients with prostate or gynecologic cancers. The pediatric health complex will be located on more than 33 acres at the corner of Harry Hines Boulevard and Paul Bass Way, and it will reportedly replace the existing Children’s Medical Center Dallas. In addition to 24-hour nursing care, the hospital will offer physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as private rooms, a therapy gym, an in-house dialysis suite, a dining room, and pharmacy. JPS Health Network, Cook Children's Health Network, the city of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, LVTRise and WestAid Food Pantry have partnered to bring a 40,000-sq-ft health center to the neighborhood, with the ribbon-cutting held August 5 at 2800 S. “The collaboration that has gone into this center is what truly makes it so special, and I’m really honored to say that Cook Children’s is a part of it,” said Rick W. Their fingerprints are all over this project and will continue to guide how we evolve in this space to best serve them.” The neighborhood health center marks the first time JPS Health Network and Cook Children's have partnered to offer healthcare in one facility.

Article: NFL recommends enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following NYC shooting The NFL is recommending enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following a shooting last month at a Manhattan office tower by a gunman authorities say was targeting league headquarters. "However, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities." Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on July 28, before he killed himself, authorities said. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested that he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be diagnosed only by examining the brain after a person dies.

Article: DAKAR, Senegal — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: How it was found Sotheby’s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

While the use of the military on American streets is alarming, it should be just as scary how blatantly this president is tying race not just to crime, but to violence so uncontrollable it requires military troops to stop it. It’s a big part of American history and our justice system has unfortunately been steeped in it, from the Jim Crow era to the 1990s war on drugs, which targeted inner cities with the same rhetoric that Trump is recycling now. Trump pointed out some tragic and horrific examples — including the beating of Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, a former employee of the president’s Department of Government Efficiency who was attacked after attempting to defend a woman during a carjacking recently, not far from the White House. But the exploitation we are seeing from Trump is a dangerous precedent to justify military force for domestic law enforcement, which until now has been forbidden — or at least assumed forbidden — by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. While it’s uncertain how that case will resolve, “Los Angeles could provide a bit of a road map for any jurisdiction seeking to push back against the Trump administration when there’s a potential threat of sending in federal troops,” Jessica Levinson, a constitutional legal scholar at Loyola Law School, told me.

Article: The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the “obsolete” H20 chip to China. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,” Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. “Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.” The top Democrat on the panel also raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

Article: Iran’s talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be “technical” and “complicated”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said, ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with it last month in the wake of the June conflict triggered by Israeli strikes. Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that a meeting may be organised with Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi during the IAEA’s visit, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks”. The IAEA’s visit marks the first to Iran since President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country on July 3 to suspend its cooperation with the nuclear watchdog after an intensive 12-day war with Israel. Pezeshkian told Al Jazeera in an interview last month that his country is prepared for any future war Israel might wage against it, adding that he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries. Relations between the IAEA and Iran deteriorated after the watchdog’s board said on June 12 that Iran had breached its non-proliferation obligations, a day before Israel’s air strikes over Iran, which sparked the conflict. “Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes, and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Araghchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate.

Article: Now, they're gearing up to fight again DALLAS — The Skillman Southwestern Library branch is once again slated for closure in Dallas' proposed municipal budget, reigniting a community fight that neighbors thought they had won a year ago. "I'm so angry and I'm so disappointed and I'm heartbroken and I was always heartbroken at the thought of losing this library and losing the staff." Community members Ashley Grossman and Caitlin Dolt, who are both part of a "Friends of Skillman Southwestern Library" group, are preparing to fight the closure again, too. "It's time to do exactly what we did last year again." The proposed budget reflects the city's commitment to public safety, with plans to hire 350 police recruits and retain seasoned officers with a goal of ending the fiscal year with 3,424 sworn police officers. "There just has to be a balance somewhere and there has to be a limit at some point." The repeated fight for the library's survival has taken an emotional toll on residents. The budget documents show the city plans to evaluate closing up to four more library branches in the 2026-2027 budget year as the library system moves to "regionalize" library services.

Article: Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

Article: Ralph Norman admitted that Trump’s tariffs are already causing higher prices, but told the American people it’s “for the good of the country.” The South Carolina Republican’s comments were met with immediate criticism, including from “The Weekend” co-hosts Jonathan Capehart and Eugene Daniels, who discussed the impact of Trump’s trade war with fellow MSNBC host Ali Velshi on Sunday. After playing a clip of Norman’s remarks, Capehart pointed out the glaring hypocrisy: “I’m sorry, wait — he said it’s for the good of the country that costs are higher? They just beat the hell out of Joe Biden when he was president because of high prices.” Daniels said Norman showed that Republicans are “accepting the reality” of his trade war. Velshi chimed in and called the tariffs “nonsensical,” going on to say the real losers are America’s small businesses, who have “no leverage.” He added: “They have no lobbying, they have no ability to negotiate, they have no ability to even determine what boat their stuff gets on. Farmers, ranchers — any small business, they can’t do this.” Velshi also discussed Trump’s “dangerous” threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, pointing out “two very distinct problems.” He explained: “Every major industrialized country has a central bank, and they all follow similar rules to make sure that the person who’s the head of the government doesn’t influence. And the problem here is that he wants to influence that.” The second problem, Velshi said, is that “inflation is a much harder problem to handle than recession.” When it comes to a recession, “the government can put money into the economy. It almost wrecked America’s future in the ’80s.” Velshi pointed out that the president has tried to exert this level of control across the government but said the scale of his attacks on the Fed is a cause for grave concern: “This is what Donald Trump is doing all over government, but he’s doing it writ large here and it’s really dangerous.”

Article: CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks Monday in a famine-stricken displacement camp outside of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, killing 40 people, local rights groups said. The Emergency Response Rooms group working at the Abu Shouk displacement camp said in a statement on Facebook that the RSF — which is at war with the Sudanese military — raided parts of the camp targeting citizens inside their homes. Meanwhile, the Resistance Committees in el-Fasher confirmed the attacks, saying on Facebook that the scene “reflected the extent of the horrific violations committed against innocent, defenseless people.” The Resistance Committees are a group of local citizens from the community that includes human rights activists. “Our forces repelled a large-scale attack from several axes by the terrorist militia and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in lives and equipment, as more than 16 combat vehicles were destroyed and burned and 34 vehicles, including armored cars, were captured,” the army claimed in a statement. Meanwhile, in North Kordofan province the RSF has been accused of displacing over 3,000 families from 66 villages due to fighting since early August, according to the Sudan Doctors Network.

Article: The Times reached out to two sources with scenarios that challenge conventional thinking — two plans for the San Fernando Valley, which, half a century ago, provided the space for much of the city’s growth. Vestiges of Reseda’s small-town beginning still survive in block after block of single-story businesses like the Traders pawnbroker and jewelry store at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way. How many more of those would be needed for Reseda, or any similar community, to contribute its fair share of the state’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the city of Los Angeles? The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. Here's how the Pacific Urbanism hybrid model could work The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. 1 MILE The low-density area could see a variety of new building sizes with the largest added along the main corridors At the moment the majority of the structures are one to four unit properties. Those changes have helped, but don’t “get us anywhere close to what’s needed to meet the target, much less in an equitable way where all communities contribute a fair share,” Alvarez said. Pacific Urbanism proposes upgrading the zoning from medium- to high-density near the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way and creating medium-density zones to replace much of what is now single-family residences and small businesses. Bury the transmission lines; build on top If you’ve spent time in the San Fernando Valley, it would be easy to view the overhead electrical transmission lines that stretch for more than 20 miles simply as essential wallpaper of modern living. The lines help ensure that 1.6 million households and businesses across the city can turn on the lights through a mostly uninterrupted band of 100- to 200-foot tall towers on a 150-foot wide strip of land.

Article: Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton's request for a temporary injunction, barring O'Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. SEE ALSO: Texas House Democrats remain out of state as redistricting showdown continues In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton's contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either "directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators" to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for "unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators' Constitutional duties." O'Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in the El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O'Rourke said Paxton was trying to "make examples out of those who fight so that others won't." "Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump, and Abbott have on power in Texas," O'Rourke said.

Article: Donald Trump’s gambits to strong-arm American companies to conform with his political agenda — be they law firms, universities or chip manufacturers — have exposed the fundamental disdain for democratic principles now being practiced by the party of “free enterprise.” Tan is the latest target. Tan visited the White House on Monday, a meeting that followed a post from Trump’s Truth Social account last week accusing him of being “conflicted” and demanding that he resign “immediately.” As Media Matters researcher Matt Gertz noted, the post from Trump’s account came minutes after a Fox Business report on a letter sent by Sen. (Tan, who was born in Malaysia, joins TikTok CEO Shou Chu as a target of Cotton’s Joseph McCarthy-esque crusade against businesspeople with ties to China.) In the letter, Cotton referred to Reuters’ reporting on Tan’s private investments and his previous job at Cadence, a tech company that recently reached a settlement in which it pleaded guilty to illegally selling semiconductor design technology to a Chinese military university. (A spokesperson for Intel told Reuters that Tan had answered questionnaires that included “disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest” and that the company handles such conflicts “appropriately.”) After Monday’s meeting, another post from Trump’s Truth Social account referred to Tan’s rise as an “amazing story” and said Tan and White House Cabinet members are going to “bring suggestions to me during the next week.” Intel released a statement calling the meeting “candid and constructive” and said the company appreciates “the President’s strong leadership.” But as the mercurial president wields his influence, it’s worth noting the facts don’t appear to be as scandalous as Trump or Cotton have implied. In a memo to staff published to Intel’s website Thursday, Tan denounced “misinformation” being spread about him and said he’s “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” The lack of any demonstrable culpability for Tan arguably highlights how blatantly authoritarian Trump’s push to oust him truly is. It’s certainly ironic that the president who eagerly welcomed Elon Musk into the fold despite his financial entanglements with China and their related national security concerns would turn around and insist that the business leader of an independent company must step down over his alleged ties to China.

Article: Trump ordered a takeover of Washington’s police President Trump said yesterday that he was temporarily taking control of the police force in Washington and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in the U.S. During a news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington, a city that he said had been taken over by “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth.” His remarks contrasted with official figures showing that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low. Trump added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” Trump has been threatening to take federal control of Washington for weeks, but he has railed against crime in largely liberal cities for decades. The Washington deployment is the latest example of Trump using the military to achieve his domestic goals; earlier this year, he sent 4,700 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles and deployed some 10,000 troops to the U.S.

Alexander McKellar offered to take her to the spot where the body was buried – and her quick thinking was crucial in cracking a case which had baffled police for three years. Tony's son Mike said that without Caroline's intervention, it was unlikely that his body would ever have been found – and expressed the family's gratitude for what she had done. Police Scotland Tony Parsons was described as a loving father, grandfather and friend Mike Parsons told BBC Scotland News that his dad was the kind of man who was always determined to complete any challenge he set himself. "I actually texted him myself, with what is my dad and myself's sense of humour, a simple text: 'Are you still alive?' "Looking back now, it's not nice to know that was the very last thing I texted to him, knowing at this point he would have been passed away." Caroline Muirhead became a key witness in a murder investigation after her boyfriend of two months confessed he killed a man. "But I basically had to convince my mum there was still a chance, and lying to somebody like that is not easy." Mike Parsons said the McKellar brothers' actions were inhumane Despite numerous public appeals including an appearance by Mike on Crimewatch, it seemed that Tony Parsons had vanished into thin air. Police had spoken to the brothers after an anonymous letter in August 2018 said they were in the Bridge of Orchy Hotel the night Tony Parsons had vanished, but no further action was taken. Crown Office The can of Red Bull dropped at the burial site allowed police to locate Tony Parsons' body It was later revealed that Tony's injuries were so bad that he would only have survived for 20 or 30 minutes without help - but it was unlikely that he had died instantly.

"Being brutally honest, I'm not so sure if I was in the same situation I would have done and thought the same way. "From my perspective, I have nothing but massive amounts of gratitude for that, because had she not done that and put herself into these positions, then we would never have found my dad's body." Tony's body was recovered from the grave in January 2021 after a two-day operation by specialist officers.

Article: The Justice Department is pressing the high court to take a Second Amendment case about a federal law that bars firearm possession by a person who “is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” The issue is due for consideration in the court’s Sept. While Maxwell’s case is far from a sure thing for review — it takes four justices to agree, and they reject most petitions — the Second Amendment issue presents a more likely candidate, at least as it’s presented by the DOJ. In its petition in the case of Ali Danial Hemani — whose prosecution, the government said, is based on his “habitual use of marijuana” — the Trump administration urged the justices to grant review because a lower court said the gun law is unconstitutional. The petition said the high court “has recently and repeatedly reviewed decisions invalidating federal statutes even in the absence of a circuit conflict.” The administration also said there is such a circuit conflict, meaning different federal appeals courts around the country ruling on an issue differently, leaving it to the justices to resolve the dispute nationwide. Hemani’s case and the [appeals court] decision below”; they said that the 5th Circuit didn’t invalidate the federal law in all its applications and that there’s no circuit split needing resolution. Solicitor General John Sauer maintained that the appeal “presents an important Second Amendment issue that affects hundreds of prosecutions every year: whether the government may disarm individuals who habitually use unlawful drugs but are not necessarily under the influence while possessing a firearm.” Though the government’s petition is a plausible candidate for review, it’s ultimately up to the justices whether and when to step in. Notably, they haven’t taken every Second Amendment appeal presented to them over the years, to the chagrin of gun rights advocates and some of the justices, such as Clarence Thomas, who lamented upon the court’s declining to consider a different gun appeal in June that the right to bear arms remains a “second-class” one without the court’s vigilance in enforcing it. Rahimi, a lopsided court ruled 8-1 that the Second Amendment permits temporarily disarming people who have been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another person.

Despite a career that unfolded in fits and starts due to racial tensions, a troubled marriage and the challenges of single motherhood, Jordan recorded one of the most beloved vocal jazz records of the 1960s, Portrait of Sheila on Blue Note Records, and was recognized 50 years later by the National Endowment of the Arts as a Jazz Master, the genre's highest honor. "That's the one I'll dedicate my life to." Jordan, who was white, became good friends with Parker — he called her "the lady with the million dollar ears." In 1952, she married one of his close collaborators, Duke Jordan, and went on to work with many Black jazz artists, often facing prejudice from other white people because of it. "That's how I survived, knowing that once or twice a week I'd get a sitter for Traci, and I'd go and sing in this club, and then I'd get up the next morning and go do my day gig."

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File) MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls — the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon — out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. “We all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,” said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab. That’s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023. Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said “it’s very little,” but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals. So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year. Zambrano highlights that his team’s work has shown that conservation works and that the effort to protect the species is also improving water quality, increasing the number of pollinizers in the area and means that Mexico City makes better use of Xochimilco’s water, among other benefits.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel — New video footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. B’Tselem says it obtained the video from the family of Awdah Hathaleen, 31, an activist, English teacher and father of three who was shot and killed on July 28, and who they said had filmed it. Levi, who is shown firing his gun twice in a video shot by another witness and obtained by The Associated Press, was briefly detained and then released from house arrest by an Israeli court, which cited lack of evidence. The shooting occurred in Umm al-Khair, a village that has long weathered settler violence in an area profiled in the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land.” Settler attacks on Palestinians have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as have attacks by Palestinian militants. “Awdah’s killing is another horrific example of how Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank, are currently living without any sort of protection, fully exposed to Israeli violence, while Israeli soldiers or settlers can kill them in broad daylight and enjoy full impunity while the world watches,” said Sarit Michaeli, the international outreach director for B’Tselem.

Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference near district headquarters, saying that the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding “safe zones” around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.” At least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools. Advertisement The public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, “all the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,” said Carvalho, with the goal of “explaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.” The district also has created a “compassion fund” to provide general help for families, including legal assistance. Los Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which, along with the City of Los Angeles, includes all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

Article: used to tell children in his youth group in Maryland that it was normal for a pastor to kiss boys on the lips, because that’s how Jesus greeted his disciples, according to an arrest warrant made public last week. Pinkerton, 52, a youth minister known as Pastor Tommy, is being held without bond following accusations that he sexually abused six teens from 2006 to 2010 while working at Central Christian Church, an Assemblies of God church in Baltimore County. He gave his life to the community, worked for the community,” Hollimon said, adding that he filed a motion Monday morning seeking another bond hearing for Pinkerton after a judge denied his release last week. “He’s anxiously waiting his day in court.” Pinkerton’s arrest comes as the Assemblies of God, the world’s largest Pentecostal denomination, with nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States, is grappling with a string of child sex abuse allegations. As part of an ongoing investigation into the denomination’s handling of abuse claims, NBC News published an investigation last week based on interviews, emails, court filings and police reports that examined how an Assemblies of God college ministry guided hundreds of students to the home of Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender lauded by some as “the holiest man alive.” Days later, Assemblies of God leaders addressed the issue of sex abuse in the denomination during a biennial gathering in Orlando, defending their handling of the Savala case while also pledging to make changes to prevent similar abuses in the future. The men alleged that when they were in their teens, Pinkerton would give them massages and rub their penises; several said Pinkerton would greet them with what he referred to as a “heavenly kiss” or “brotherly kiss” on the lips, likening this to Jesus. Assemblies of God officials distanced themselves from Pinkerton on Monday, telling NBC News that, although Pinkerton worked at an Assemblies of God church, he was never formally credentialed as a minister with the denomination. “We are so saddened to hear of this report, and are deeply concerned whenever reports like this come out,” said Benjamin Rainey Jr., secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God regional office that oversees the three-state region that includes Maryland. In a statement posted last week on its website, Central Christian said Pinkerton served on its staff more than 15 years ago and hasn’t been affiliated with the church since he left to start his own ministry. In the years since the alleged abuse occurred, Pinkerton has preached in at least six different states, NBC News found, and according to his ministry website, he has evangelized in South America, Europe and Asia. One church where he preached, the New Chapel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is not an Assemblies of God church, posted on its website over the weekend that it had cut ties with Pinkerton before he was arrested. “We were heartbroken to hear of these serious allegations that occurred in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 20 years ago, and communicated the situation to our church family after severing all ties with the accused several months back.

Meanwhile, the national drought group - which includes the Met Office, regulators, the government, and water companies - has warned that England is now suffering from "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The group said England is experiencing widespread environmental and agricultural effects from the shortage of water, which is hitting crop yields, reducing feed for livestock, damaging river wildlife and wetlands, as well as increasing wildfires. A jet stream to the north and high pressure to the east is drawing up hot and humid air from the south As high pressure has pushed eastwards, the UK has been drawing in some very warm air on a southerly to south easterly wind from the European continent, where temperatures have been particularly high.

Article: The reconciliation bill President Donald Trump signed last month increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention budget by more than 300%, making the immigration enforcement machine’s budget comparable to that of some foreign armed forces. ICE has begun hiring thousands of new agents; it is trying to lure recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, and last week Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires. The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy. As we at the American Immigration Council laid out in a recent report, Trump’s second-term immigration policies, in just six months, represent an unprecedented and coordinated assault on democratic rights and principles. And despite the Fifth Amendment’s promise of due process, the administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s hellhole CECOT prison, based on vague, unchallengeable allegations of gang affiliation. In addition to hiring thousands of new ICE agents, the federal government is rapidly expanding detention capacity, filling private jails and converted military sites with thousands of people, most of whom have never been charged with a crime. In immigrant-heavy communities, people are afraid to report real crime — like in Tennessee, where, according to a police chief, a child may have died because their noncitizen caretaker was scared to call 911 given the recent immigration raids in the state.

She gave out fliers saying, “Allah is a Gay God” in a Muslim neighborhood in England, popularized the idea that there’s a white genocide in South Africa and interviewed the reactionary philosopher Alexander Dugin on a trip to Moscow seemingly arranged by shadowy Russian interests. “A victim.” After her encounter with Tate, she wrote, her life “unraveled.” She yearned to escape her own infamy and the need to keep shoveling more outrageous content into the internet’s insatiable maw. She posted photos of herself baking, and “selfies in the mirror showing how quickly I had bounced back to fitness and health after pregnancy.” But in reality, she wrote, her life was “hell.” She’d moved with her husband from Canada, where she’d grown up, to his native Australia, where she lived in near-total isolation.

Article: A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit established by Congress to bolster democracy worldwide that had been paralyzed by the loss of funding earlier this year. Friedrich of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in her 15-page ruling that the Trump administration had withheld funds from the nonprofit “for impermissible policy reasons,” and that the endowment had suffered irreparable harm in the form of layoffs of critical staff members and suspension of several democracy-supporting initiatives. “These harms to the endowment’s global reputation and to the ‘very existence of its programs’ are irreparable,” Judge Friedrich wrote, ordering the release of $95 million in federal funds to the nonprofit — roughly 30 percent of its annual budget. The endowment, which has been denounced by major authoritarian powers like China and Russia, was one of several U.S.-backed human rights groups that fell victim to aggressive cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency, a group led by Elon Musk that sought to slash much of the government soon after President Trump returned to office.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). “This is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,” Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. “In fact, it’s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.” The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia’s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday.

Article: Bank of America thinks the Federal Reserve may want to hold off on cutting interest rates at the end of its next FOMC meeting in the wake of the latest jobs report. "We think those FOMC members that argue for cuts don't put enough weight on the labor supply shock or the fact that inflation is stuck above target, with risks of a larger and more persistent shock after the latest tariff hikes," economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote on Monday. "Cutting in September may risk starting the easing cycle without evidence that inflation has peaked." He also said that he still doesn't expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. "The downward revision to nonfarm payrolls increases the probability of what we view as the most likely alternate scenario: 'bad cuts,' due to deterioration in the labor market," Irigoyen wrote.

Article: Bill Essayli’s request to dismiss charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who has already been convicted of a felony for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest, ordering him to start his prison sentence this month. Wilson said the government’s effort to overturn a jury conviction was “contrary to the public interest.” The ruling brought to a close a criminal case involving an unusual post-trial plea agreement, which triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May and ultimately saw the felony reduced to a misdemeanor. Advertisement In an 11-page ruling, Wilson cited a lack of new evidence or change in circumstances of the case in denying the motion to in effect erase the prosecution of L.A. But after Essayli, a staunch supporter of President Trump, was named top federal prosecutor for the area in April, he ordered a review of the case and sought its unraveling. Advertisement A federal jury found Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law after he violently threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023. “Indeed, after the Court rejected its request for probation and imposed a custodial sentence, the Government responded by seeking to dismiss all charges — ensuring Defendant serves no time at all.” A spokesman for the U.S. Caree Harper, who has served as a victim’s rights attorney for the woman Kirk was convicted of assaulting, celebrated the ruling as a minor victory in the face of Essayli’s broader assault on the case. Late last month, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the judgment against Kirk, citing “misgivings about the case.” They also moved to drop charges in another controversial criminal case, involving Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains. The motions to dismiss came the same day that the Trump administration moved to extend Essayli’s term as L.A.’s top federal law enforcement official, despite flouting the normal confirmation process for prosecutorial appointees. “There’s nothing left.” Essayli’s decision to offer the deputy a lenient postconviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections. Faerstein told jurors Kirk used excessive force against Houseton by slamming her to the ground and pepper-spraying her “when it was unnecessary to do so.” Kirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded. In handing down the four-month sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury’s view, Kirk’s actions were “just plain inexplicable.” He said that Kirk “knew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,” before he pepper-sprayed Houseton. Keenan told the judge that the office found no new evidence but argued not enough attention had been paid to “acts of resistance.” “Didn’t the jury see all that?” Wilson questioned. The jury saw all of it.” After the hearing last week, activists confronted Keenan in the hallway, telling him “this is bigger than Kirk.” Among them was Raycine Ector, the lead organizer of Cancel the Contract Antelope Valley, a community coalition advocating for ending contracts between the Sheriff’s Department and local cities and schools.

Article: The law, Senate Bill 37, is part of a broader effort by Republican lawmakers to assert more control over public universities following years of clashes with faculty over issues like tenure, diversity initiatives and academic freedom. Other university systems, including Texas A&M, University of Houston and University of North Texas, are taking steps to preserve their faculty senates and avoid a gap in faculty representation by restructuring them ahead of the Sept. The University of Houston System said it began planning for a new faculty council earlier this summer, and its board is scheduled to vote on the updated policies and bylaws in August. The Texas Tech University System has indicated it plans to retain its faculty senates in accordance with the new law, though it’s unclear what steps it has taken in that direction. “It’s a head-scratching moment to wonder how and why the effort looks so different,” said Joseph Velasco, a professor at Sul Ross State University, which is part of the Texas State University System. “It risks breaking the thread of shared governance that keeps the university healthy and accountable.” At Sul Ross, faculty who teach at least six credit hours a semester automatically become members of the faculty assembly, a body that functions like a faculty senate and advises the administration. Faculty senates, which have traditionally elected their own leaders and representatives, will look drastically different under SB 37, even at those universities opting to keep their faculty senates and adapt them to comply with the law. “Continuity matters because a functioning faculty senate serves as a check and balance within the university.” Mark Criley, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said the administration could also use the new faculty senates to make it appear as if they have faculty support when they do not. SB 37 requires faculty senates to broadcast their meetings when a majority of members are present, record attendance on critical votes, and post agendas seven days in advance, a stricter standard than the 72-hour requirement under the Texas Open Meetings Act. The law also allows university administrators to remove faculty senate members for “failing to conduct the member’s responsibilities within the council or senate’s parameters, failing to attend council or senate meetings or engaging in similar misconduct.” The law doesn’t define what qualifies as misconduct. Last year, more than 500 professors at Creighton’s alma mater, UT-Austin, signed a petition calling for the removal of then-President Jay Hartzell over his decision to have law enforcement respond to peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. Coby Condrey, a librarian who serves as chair of the UNT faculty senate, said that he expects to continue that strategy under SB 37, and that UNT’s administration will respond in kind. He anticipates the UNT System’s board of regents will authorize faculty senates at their meeting later this month, and said UNT President Harrison Keller has already agreed to consider faculty recommendations when selecting appointees. “We know that it is always going to be better for the faculty to have the administration at least hear our concerns, even if not all of the decisions might be the ones that we would prefer,” Condrey said. Disclosure: Southern Methodist University, Sul Ross University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, University of Houston, University of North Texas, University of Texas System and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: What we learnt from Nicola Sturgeon's memoir 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save BBC Nicola Sturgeon's memoir Frankly is now on sale, slightly earlier than expected after newspaper serialisations and interviews teased some tantalising extracts. Spindrift Isla Bryson was jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape Sturgeon also addresses the case of double rapist Adam Graham who was initially sent to a female prison after self-identifying as a woman called Isla Bryson. "In football parlance, I lost the dressing room." Speaking to ITV News on Monday Sturgeon said she now believed a rapist "probably forfeits the right" to identify as a woman. JK Rowling JK Rowling posted a selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Sturgeon as a "destroyer of women's rights" The former first minister also criticises her highest profile opponent on the gender issue, Harry Potter author JK Rowling, for posting a selfie in a T-shirt bearing the slogan "Nicola Sturgeon, destroyer of women's rights". Her relationship with Alex Salmond Sturgeon's mentor and predecessor as first minster, Alex Salmond, is mentioned dozens of times in the book, often in unflattering terms which reflect their estrangement after he was accused of sexual offences. Salmond won a judicial review of the Scottish government's handling of complaints against him and in 2020 was cleared of all 13 charges but his reputation was sullied by revelations in court about inappropriate behaviour with female staff. "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy," she writes, adding: "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all". The campaign was tough, she says, partly because of what she calls unbalanced coverage by the British media including the BBC and partly because Salmond left her to do much of the heavy lifting. PA Media Sturgeon claims Alex Salmond showed little interest in the "detail" of the independence white paper A key period in the lead-up to the poll was her preparation, as deputy first minister, of a white paper setting out the case for independence. Getty Images Sturgeon described her house as looking like a murder scene Text here Leading Scotland during the pandemic For Sturgeon, the coronavirus pandemic which struck the world five years ago still provokes "a torrent of emotion". She says she will be haunted forever by the thought that going into lockdown earlier could have saved more lives and, in January 2024, after she wept while giving evidence to the UK Covid inquiry, she "came perilously close to a breakdown". PA Media Nicola Sturgeon appeared visibly upset when giving evidence to the Covid Inquiry Text here Misogyny and sexism Scathing comments about the inappropriate behaviour of men are scattered throughout the book. "Like all women, since the dawn of time, I have faced misogyny and sexism so endemic that I didn't always recognize it as such," Sturgeon writes on the very first page. Sturgeon says a male MSP from a rival party taunted her with the nickname "gnasher" as he spread a false rumour that she had injured a boyfriend during oral sex. Nicola Sturgeon says she may have appeared to be a confident and combative leader but underneath she is a "painfully shy" introvert who has "always struggled to believe in herself." She writes in detail about the "excruciating pain" and heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage after becoming pregnant at the age of 40. Sturgeon touches on the end of her marriage, saying "I love him" but the strain of the past couple of years was "impossible to bear." She also writes about her experience of the menopause, explaining that "one of my deepest anxieties was that I would suddenly forget my words midway through an answer" at First Minister's Question Time.

The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute "is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy". "The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be," they said. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year. The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking "substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI". A Charity Commission spokesperson said: "We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us." They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation. Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's "ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders".

The Ukrainian leader’s warnings come in advance of Trump’s scheduled meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, and after the US president said that Kyiv would have to cede land to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a proposition that Ukraine has firmly rejected. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also said on Monday that a peace deal for Ukraine must involve Kyiv and not be imposed upon it. US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which monitors the conflict in Ukraine on a daily basis, said in a recent report that Moscow does not appear to be preparing the Russian public for accepting “a settlement short of a full victory in Ukraine”. European leaders and Zelenskyy plan to speak with Trump in advance of his meeting with Putin as fears mount that Washington may dictate unfavourable peace terms to Ukraine after the Alaska summit.

Article: “It’s a very complicated subject.” Trump said that while he had heard “great things” about medical-use cannabis, he had heard bad things about “just about everything else” to do with the drug. “Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children.” Stocks in cannabis-related businesses soared following Trump’s remarks.

Article: The bot, which has become widely embraced on X as a way for users to fact-check or respond to other users’ arguments, posted that it had been taken offline over various statements it made regarding U.S and global politics, ranging from claims of genocide in Gaza to discussions about homicide rates by race. At the time, the Grok account acknowledged the posts and said xAI “has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” In a statement posted on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologized “for the horrific behavior that many experienced.” “Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users,” the statement read. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.” In May, Grok was involved in another controversy when it brought up South African “white genocide” claims as responses to unconnected inquires. When users asked why Grok was issuing such responses, the chatbot said its “creators at xAI” instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa and the ‘kill the Boer’ chant, as they viewed it as racially motivated,” according to The Guardian. Grok also acknowledged the glitch, writing that it will "focus on relevant, verified information going forward.” Even with its troubles, Grok has become one of the most public and recognizable AI chatbots due to its integration within X, where it has become a go-to for people looking for context, information and fact-checking. In a series of responses Monday after it came back online, Grok repeatedly stated without prompting that its “account was suspended after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza.” The posts have since been removed.

Article: Just hours after President Donald Trump said he would deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C., a federal judge in San Francisco heard arguments Monday about whether the administration violated federal law when it mobilized troops to Los Angeles this summer. Gavin Newsom and to stop using the military “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law.” The federal government is arguing that the deployment of the National Guard and Marines was solely to support immigration officials, who were impeded by large-scale protests across the city in early June. In response, the Department of Defense ordered some 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as thousands of immigration activists and supporters marched in the streets and outside federal buildings to show their opposition to Trump's mass deportation effort. The state sued the Trump administration for what it called an unwarranted deployment and won an early victory from Breyer, who found the federal government had violated the 10th Amendment clarifying the balance of power between federal and state governments. The case, which is expected to continue through Wednesday, could set a precedent for how the Trump administration handles future deployments of federal troops in D.C., Baltimore and other cities led by Democratic mayors. (Newsom and Bass are Democrats.) “The factual question, which the court must address, is whether the military was used to enforce domestic law, and if so, whether there continues to be a threat that will be done again,” Breyer told the court. Harrington, who did not participate in or witness work in the field, said he raised concerns about the Posse Comitatus Act on June 7 during a task force briefing before federal forces arrived in Los Angeles. During questioning by state Deputy Attorney General Jane Reilley, Harrington said he worried that if the California National Guard was deployed, it would lose law enforcement authority because of the statute and be reduced to a supportive role. That was the case when federal forces accompanied immigration agents to separate operations at Los Angeles' MacArthur Park and a cannabis cultivation center in Camarillo, north of L.A., Harrington said. “The soldiers actually did not engage in any activity.” Prior to deploying at MacArthur Park on July 7, when federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out across the mostly empty space, Harrington received an intelligence report that did “not indicate a high-value target or threat to federal functions at this location,” he said. During an immigration enforcement action in Mecca, a desert community about 142 miles east of Los Angeles, approximately 300 task force soldiers were present, compared to 200 federal law enforcement agents, Sherman said. Breyer appeared to bristle on multiple occasions, at one point arguing with both Sherman and DOJ attorneys about whether federal forces can intervene any time people protest a law they dislike. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, testified that federal intervention was necessary because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd of 1,500 gathered outside the federal building on June 6 to protest immigration arrests. “That impacted our ability to conduct our missions.” Lawyers with the DOJ asked Breyer for a quick judgment at the end of the day, arguing that the state had failed to make its case.

Article: NEW YORK — AriZona Iced Tea's legendary 99-cent price tag may finally face its end after nearly three decades, as company leadership grapples with the financial impact of new aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Don Vultaggio, the founder and chairman of AriZona Beverage Company, told The New York Times he is reluctantly considering raising prices on the company's signature tallboy cans for the first time since 1997, when the iconic 99-cent price was established. Just over a year ago, Vultaggio affirmed his commitment to keeping the price at 99 cents for "the foreseeable future." "I hate even the thought of it," Vultaggio told The Times. "It would be a hell of a shame after 30-plus years." The potential price increase stems from the Trump administration's 50% tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, according to The Times. About 80% of the aluminum AriZona uses comes from recycled material produced in the United States, while the remainder is imported from Canada and now subject to the 50% import duty, The Times reported. Vultaggio told The Times that aluminum prices have been "dramatically bumped up because of this tariff talk," and he expects domestic aluminum manufacturers to raise their prices in response to the tariffs. The 73-year-old founder, whose childhood in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood shaped his approach to affordability, established AriZona's business model around three simple principles: make it taste good, make it look good and price it right. Vultaggio expressed hope to The Times that the tariff dispute will be resolved, but acknowledged that "at some point the consumer is going to have to pay the price" if it is not.

Article: BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out World-famous coral reefs along Western Australia's (WA) coast have suffered the worst bleaching on record after the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave, scientists say. Between last August and this May, warmer water temperatures led to significant heat stress on the reefs, causing many of the coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal. "The length and intensity of the heat stress, and its footprint across multiple regions, is something we've never seen before on most of the reefs in Western Australia," James Gilmour, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), said. In a new report, the Aims researchers found the 2024-25 season was the "most severe coral bleaching on record" for WA coral reefs across both the northwestern and central reefs.

Article: “I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the conference in which he was joined by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control. “Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I’m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act… and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,” he said. “And nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.” According to a report by the news outlet Politico, federal law enforcement officers will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and national monuments. The “rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government”, the order states. “The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.” It also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president “on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia”. SAFE AGAIN 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/xJRIcgy4ld — The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 11, 2025 According to reports, the move seems to have been triggered by an assault involving Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer and protege of Elon Musk, who previously led DOGE. “If DC doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, days after the attack, with an image showing a shirtless Coristine with what appeared to be blood spattered on his face, body and trousers. “Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime,” Trump added. The mayor of Washington, DC, Bowser, questioned the effectiveness of deploying the National Guard to enforce local laws, saying that more funding for prosecutors would make a more meaningful difference.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has tapped an economist from a conservative think tank to lead a key statistics agency after firing its previous head over her role in the release of weak employment figures. Trump’s nomination of Antoni, who requires confirmation by the US Senate, comes after his firing of Erika McEntarfer earlier this month raised concerns about US government statistics remaining credible and free of political influence. Trump justified McEntarfer’s dismissal by claiming, without evidence, that the latest jobs report, which showed sharply slower jobs growth for May and June than previously estimated, had been “rigged” to make him look bad. After Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with Japan last month, Antoni described the agreement as “darn close” to perfect and the US president and his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as “artistic masters”. Last week, Antoni said in a social media post that there were “better ways to collect, process, and disseminate” economic data, and that the next head of the BLS would need to deliver “accurate data in a timely manner” to rebuild trust in the agency.

Article: You feel much safer.” Snider is among a half-dozen policing and military experts who told NBC News they were perplexed by President Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and order the National Guard to help fight crime in Washington, D.C. as a crime-infested hellscape and said Attorney General Pam Bondi would “take command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.” In making his case, Trump ticked off recent violent incidents in Washington, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern and the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, an original Department of Government Efficiency staffer known online as "Big Balls." “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump said. President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, from left, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from right, during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, on Monday. “However, we emphasize that federal intervention must be a temporary measure, with the ultimate goal of empowering a fully staffed and supported MPD to protect our city effectively.” Concern from former chiefs The announcement of the federal takeover was met with alarm by Art Acevedo, a retired police chief who led departments in Houston, Austin and Miami. “There’s no reason for it other than the political optics sought by the administration to pretend that crime is out of control and they are the saviors.” Trump said that he had appointed the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the head of the Metropolitan Police Department. At her own press conference later in the day, Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions “unsettling and unprecedented.” The attorney general of D.C., Brian Schwab, had also blasted the move and said that he was exploring legal options, but Bowser acknowledged that Trump had the authority to temporarily seize control of the police department. She noted, however, that “nothing about our organizational chart has changed.” Trump must notify certain members of Congress within 48 hours about the reason for taking over control of police and the estimated timeline for federal control, according to the D.C. They know where the violence occurs,” said Snider, who is an adjunct lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a policy director of criminal justice and civil liberties at the R Street Institute, a think tank in D.C. Daniel Hodges, one of dozens of Metropolitan Police Department officers who were brutalized during the riot and whose assailants were among those pardoned by Trump upon his return to office, woke up to the news that Trump had taken over the MPD after working an overnight shift.
